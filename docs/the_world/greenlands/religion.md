# Religion

#### Divinity

> According to ancient myth, the gods came to this realm countless millennia ago. They spoke to all the creatures of the world using spirits of nature as their messengers and sought to pass along the secrets of civilization. Only four races proved themselves worthy to learn agriculture, language, and magic. These races were collectively known as the [Kindred](../../character_creation/race/index), and upon the completion of their instruction, the gods wordlessly departed.
> 
> Scholars have long questioned the historical value of the myth. The existence of [City Dwellers](../city_dwellers/index) further cast doubt on the matter, much to the displeasure of many cults. A large subset of the Navean population considers City Dwellers to be an imaginative [Piper's](../../character_creation/background/piper) tale.

#### Mystery Cults

> Like their [real world analogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_mysteries), mystery cults are organizations that fulfill the religious needs of the wider public while reserving higher order secrets for [initiates](../../character_creation/class/cleric). They officiate over important ceremonies, cleanse lingering spirits, and offer theories about the nature of existence.
>
> Nearly all cults fall under the umbrella of the [Life Domain](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_life) with practitioners channeling lifeforce to perform miracles. Among some sects these miracles are considered the work of deities. Among others, they are treated as skillful applications of qi.
> 
> There are, however, other cults whose powers are less benign. [Winter Witches](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_winter) are said to gain their magic by sacrificing animals on stone altars, while [Demon Worshippers](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_hell) curry favor from malevolent ghosts. Both have similar wells of inner energy, but are capable of vastly different miracles.



<!-- #### Politics and Pragmatics

> Initiation into a cult involves complex rituals that change the physical and psychological state of an individual. Priests are, at a fundamental level, no longer the same people that they were. Some develop glowing eyes as a result of their induction. Others become larger and stronger. Universally, the process renders an inductee incapable of having offspring.
> 
> Because of these changes, priests cannot hold political office or noble titles in any land. They are disqualified from lines of succession. If they have heirs, those heirs inherit, and the priest in question is forced to step down as though they were deceased. Thus is a separation between the political world and the spiritual world enforced. -->
