# Humans

#### Overview

> Humanity forms the base of every nation's workforce as the most numerous Kindred race. They serve as farmers, miners, soldiers, and occasionally craftsmen. They receive little education and have comparatively few rights, leading a considerable number to strike out as adventurers in the hopes of escaping poverty. 

#### Servile Clans

> The most fortunate of humans live in clans dedicated to an influential family of Elves or Dwarves. Owing to differences in lifespan, several generations might serve the same lord as spies, wizards, elite warriors, or household staff. Descendants of these clans tend to be [unusually skilled](../../character_creation/race/human#variant).

#### Dwarven Dissent

> Humans have a better quality of life in the Dwarven City-States than near anywhere else. Though citizenship is denied to them, human craftsman and soldiers are guaranteed rights proportionate to their station. Dwarven politicians with populist leanings have formed strong power bases with humans at their core. Humans even have (Dwarven) representatives called Tribunes who defend their legal statuses.
> 
> Even still, many humans are eager for more political power. Those that are not content with merely supporting agreeable Dwarven representatives pursue influence by other means. Human merchants and guilds are steadily becoming a force all of their own, a fact that makes many Dwarves nervous.

#### Age of Legends

> The earliest Elven records speak of dangerous human factions that existed before their race was brought to heel. Human [necromancers](../../adventuring/languages#abyssal) who marshalled vast armies of the dead. Human [dragon riders](../../adventuring/languages#sylvan) that bonded with wyverns and fought from the skies. A thousand years were spent on their subjugation, culminating in the erasure of all such records from public histories. Now only the most trusted of High Elven scholars are permitted to know how close the Empire once came to destruction at human hands.
