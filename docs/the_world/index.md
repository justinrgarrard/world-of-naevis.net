# The World

#### The Canvaslands

> A [lawless shantytown](canvaslands/index) of yurts and market stalls that sprung up around the City's entrance. Within its unmarked boundaries are tradesmen, soldiers, camp followers, and aspiring adventurers. 

#### The City Below

> The City Below, also called the **[Forgotten City](city_below)** or the **City Itself**, is a subterranean otherworld. It was discovered several years prior in the Nameless Desert. The great powers of Naevis covet its treasures.

#### The Greenlands

> The settled, fertile lands on the northern half of the continent. The Elven Empire, the Dwarven City-States, and the Human Kingdoms are all located within this region. Food and drink in the Nameless Desert is imported from these lands at great expense.
