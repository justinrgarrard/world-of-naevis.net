# Undead

#### Overview

> Ghosts can be found on the surface world as well as within the City. They are unthinking echoes of intelligent creatures who died tragic deaths. If a ghost is left uncleansed for years, it will gradually form a twisted and hateful personality, transforming into a demon. 
>
> The weakest of demons are shambling corpses that feed on the living. Should they succeed, their monstrous shape will gradually reform into ghouls, vampires, and other greater undead.

#### Settlements

> Undead are most common in abandoned areas where no priests or shamans might pass by. More powerful undead will venture to the fringes of societies in order to secure food. A small number may create [demon worshipping cults](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_hell) for the same reasons.

#### Disposition

> Undead are defined by their vile nature. They do not possess a capacity for kindness or honor. Some, particularly vampires, can skillfully impersonate virtues despite an inability to understand them. Undead are universally driven by a desire to consume life.
