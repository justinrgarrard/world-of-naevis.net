# The City Below

#### Discovery

> The City was discovered within the decade by a [Piper](../character_creation/background/piper) that had lost her way while traveling the Nameless Desert. The crumbling sandstone buildings suggest the outline of a once-great city, though no historical records can be found mentioning its existence. The [Elves](../character_creation/race/elf) are especially unsettled by this, given their extensive record keeping over numerous generations.

#### The City Above

> There is little to be seen of the City surface-side. No carvings, no burial grounds or temples, nothing at all to suggest what sort of place it may once have been. The remnants are piecemeal and shattered. A few sects of scholars have suggested that the City Above may have been destroyed by some great disaster.

#### The City Below

> All that is of interest to the adventuring world exists beneath ground. Crude tunnels can be found in the basements and collapsed courtyards of the City Above. They wind in a maddening labyrinth that defies modern cartography.
> 
> While some have suggested that magic is to blame, others feel that it is simply untenable to sketch out a three-dimensional chart of sufficient complexity. Some tunnels cross one another. Some go over, under, and around known routes. Collapses are frequent and many a party has found themselves exiting miles from where they entered.

<!-- **Language**

> Unlike the Kindred, City Dwellers share the same spoken [language](../../adventuring/languages) (Undercommon) and written language (Infernal) regardless of race. They are notably not proficient in Common. 

**Magic**

> City Dwellers do not use magic as Kindred do. They are neither wizards nor clerics, instead seeming to practice entirely distinct traditions of spellcraft. They are generally superior spellcasters, and all are capable of using spell scrolls.

**Technology**

> While inhabitants of the City tend to have stronger magic, their technological prowess is considerably weaker. Their weapons are made of stone and bone, and their clothing is made of monster hides.

**Architecture**

> Buildings are uncommon in the City Below. Underground living is largely bereft of weather and seasons, removing one of the main impetuses for lasting shelters. Instead, camps and decorated caves make up the most common living quarters. Most are charmed with exotic forms of warding to sound alarms or rebuke trespassers.

**Religion**

> Denizens of the City worship the [Nine Devil Princes](devil_princes), a pantheon of supposed demigods. These Princes have no known cult in the surface world. Where the gods of Kindred are held to exist outside of the physical world, the Devil Princes are rumored to walk among their followers in the flesh. 

**Economy**

> City Dwellers operate on a barter economy. Scrolls are the nearest approximation of currency, being both lightweight and useful for daily life. More valuable transactions may be conducted with [Elemental Crystals](../../more/items/elemental_crystals). -->
