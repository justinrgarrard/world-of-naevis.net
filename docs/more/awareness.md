# Awareness

#### Passive Perception

An adventurer's **Passive Perception** determines what they notice without rolling any dice. The Game Master jots down each character's Passive Perception before the game begins and reveals additional details about the environment based on that value. For example:

* **Passive Perception 10**: You enter the alchemist's lab and see it in disarray, vials turned over and glass broken.

* **Passive Perception 15**: You also smell a chemical odor in the room that makes you dizzy. It may not be safe to enter.

> Passive Perception is equal to **10 + Wisdom Modifier**.
>
> If the character has proficiency in the Perception skill, it is **10 + Wisdom Modifier + Proficiency Bonus**.


#### Active Investigation

Active attempts to find treasure or sleuth out clues use an **Intelligence (Investigation)** roll. When a player asks, "Is there anything valuable in the room?", the Game Master will usually respond, "Roll Investigation."

> * Adventurers receive a -5 penalty to [Passive Perception](../more/awareness) in _Dim Light_.

> * Adventurers are blinded in _Darkness_.

> * Elf and Dwarf adventurers have the Darkvision trait, which allows them to treat _Darkness_ as _Dim Light_ for 60 feet. They also treat _Dim Light_ as _Bright Light_ within the same range.


#### Stealth

When a player wishes to move quietly or hide, the Game Master (not the player) rolls in secret and adds the appropriate modifier. The player is unaware of the result, and thus believes themselves hidden.
