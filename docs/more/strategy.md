#### How Not To Die

##### Stop Fighting Everything

> _You see a band of goblins. Grinning, you reach for your wand and cast the most destructive spell you know, clearing the path. Then you see the goblin camp that they were guarding, and the six goblin war bands rushing out to take revenge._
>
> Violence is a useful tool in an adventurer's arsenal. But it is not the only tool, and parties that treat it as such will end up dead before finishing their first dungeon.
>
> **Use Diplomacy, Bribes, and Ambushes** to avoid wasting resources on a brawl. Take care not to get into fights that you can't win. No amount of bravado will let a first-level party go toe-to-toe with a dragon. Similarly, when you decide to fight, make it as one-sided as possible by choosing favorable terrain and surprising your targets.


##### Use Your Head

> _There is a cloud of mushroom spores ahead, filling the nearby room. You look at your hit points and decide that they're pretty high; you don't really need to worry about every little hazard, do you? You step forward and the flame from your torch cause the spores to explode. The party cleric behind you fails their DEX save and is knocked unconscious, just as a group of bandits come out to investigate the commotion._
>
> **When faced with an unusual feature, spend some time investigating it.** Can you determine if it's poisonous? Can you tell if it's magical? If you poke it with a stick, does something happen?
>
> Adventurers have a bevy of skills, spells, and abilities used to understand the world around them. Players likewise can conduct common sense experiments without any special powers. You don't need to cast a spell to see if something is an illusion; just throw a rock and the truth will be revealed.


##### Collect Tools

> _You cast Fire bolt, but it washes over the hellhound uselessly. You look over your character sheet and notice that you do not have any weapons, nor any spells that deal non-fire damage. The hound growls in your direction and charges._
>
> **Adventuring rewards preparation and punishes over-optimization.** Expect to have swords break, spells fail, rations get stolen, and torches get wet.
>
> Flexibility is key. Pick up a set of darts. Keep spare wands in your backpack, and daggers strapped to your thighs. Every adventurer should be prepared for the unexpected.

#### Character Creation Tips

##### Be More Than a Statblock

> The abilities listed on a character sheet are not the full extent of their actions. Every character, regardless of class, can shove a bandit off a cliff or throw a flask of oil behind them to slow down pursuers.

##### Don't Overspecialize

> A character should be good at their job, but not to the extent that they're useless at everything else. If a spellcaster is only useful when they have spell slots, they're not useful at all. Likewise, a fighter that devotes themselves solely to archery would be better served by carrying around a healthy mix of weapons.
