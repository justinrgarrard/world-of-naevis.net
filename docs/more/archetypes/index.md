# Archetypes

| **Fighter** | [Champion](../../../data/archetypes/fighter_champion)  |
| **Rogue**   | [Thief](../../../data/archetypes/rogue_thief)          |

#### Adapting Archetypes

Should your Game Master allow other archetypes, they may require adjustments for use in this setting. 


##### Guidelines

> * **Replace Spells** that do not exist in the _Basic Rules_ with those that do.
> 
> * **Provide Context** for where your abilities come from in this setting.


##### Example: War Domain

> _Clerics of the War domain draw their power from qi, gradually accumulating power through training and meditation. Their tradition stems from the Elven Empire and places great importance on demonstrating skill through combat._
>
> Note that the spells for this archetype have been changed to their nearest Basic Rules equivalents.
