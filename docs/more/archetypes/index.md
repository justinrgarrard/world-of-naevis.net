# Archetypes

By default, the four _Basic Rules_ archetypes are permitted for use in this setting.

| Class   | Archetype                                              |
| :------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Cleric  | [Life](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_life)           |
| Fighter | [Champion](../../../data/archetypes/fighter_champion)  |
| Rogue   | [Thief](../../../data/archetypes/rogue_thief)          |
| Wizard  | [Evocation](../../../data/archetypes/wizard_evocation) |

#### Setting Archetypes

These optional archetypes were designed for use with Naevis and can be used as-is.

| Class       | Archetypes                                              |                                                         |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cleric**  | [Dream Cult](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_dream)     | [Hell Cult](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_hell)       |
|             | [Stone Cult](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_stone)     | [Winter Cult](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_winter)   |
| **Fighter** | [Lionheart](../../../data/archetypes/fighter_lionheart) | [Warprince](../../../data/archetypes/fighter_warprince) |
| **Rogue**   | [Delver](../../../data/archetypes/rogue_delver)         | [Knife Dancer](../../../data/archetypes/rogue_knife)    |
| **Wizard**  | [Court Mage](../../../data/archetypes/wizard_court)     | [Tower Mage](../../../data/archetypes/wizard_tower)     |


#### External Archetypes

Other archetypes may be used with GM permission, provided that they can be adapted for use in the Naevis setting. The archetypes below can be used as-is without changes. Others may need modifications to fit the setting.

| Class       | Archetypes       |               |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :------------ |
| **Cleric**  | -                |               |
| **Fighter** | Banneret         | Battle Master |
|             | Eldritch Knight  | Samurai       |
| **Rogue**   | Arcane Trickster | Scout         |
|             | Swashbuckler     |               |
| **Wizard**  | Abjuration       | Bladesinging  |
|             | Enchantment      | Illusion      |
|             | War Magic        |               |

{: .note}
> **Cleric Domains**
>
> Cleric subclasses typically require a minimal change to their list of spells for use in Naevis. See the War Domain example for reference.

#### Adapting Archetypes

Archetypes from outside the _Basic Rules_ may require customization for use in this setting. Some, like the Echo Knight, may involve too much magic for a low-fantasy setting. Others may provide spells that aren't included in the _Basic Rules_. Work with your Game Master to adjust or reflavor features as necessary.

**Keep in mind that the GM can veto an archetype.**


{: .note}
> **Guidelines**
> 
> * **Replace Spells** that do not exist in the _Basic Rules_ with those that do.
> 
> * **Reflavor Magical Effects** as martial techniques or feats of skill.
> 
> * **Provide Context** for where your abilities come from in this setting.


#### Example: War Domain

The Cleric War domain can be repurposed with minor changes to its spell list. Note that the replacement spells have a theme close to their originals. 

| Cleric Level |                                                                      Spells |
| :----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 1st          |        [Cure Wounds](../../../data/srd_spells/cure_wounds), Shield of Faith |
| 3rd          |                                              Magic Weapon, Spiritual Weapon |
| 5th          | [Beacon of Hope](../../../data/srd_spells/beacon_of_hope), Spirit Guardians |
| 7th          |                                              Freedom of Movement, Stoneskin |
| 9th          |   Flame Strike, [Dominate Person](../../../data/srd_spells/dominate_person) |

#### Example: Rune Knight

The Fighter Rune Knight archetype can be themed as a warrior or scholar seeking out fragments of the [Giant](../../adventuring/languages#giant) language. They may have an adversarial relationship with the [Stone Legionnaires](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_stone) as presumed plunderers of knowledge typically reserved for initiates.

In terms of mechanics, the Rune Knight archetype is largely compatible as-is, but a Game Master might remove the size increase ability to avoid veering into high fantasy.
