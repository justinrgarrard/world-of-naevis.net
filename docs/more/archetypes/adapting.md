# Adapting Archetypes

Archetypes from outside the _Basic Rules_ may require customization for use in this setting. Some, like the Echo Knight, may involve too much magic for a low-fantasy setting. Others may provide spells that aren't included in the _Basic Rules_. Work with your Game Master to adjust or reflavor features as necessary.

**Keep in mind that the GM can veto an archetype.**


{: .note}
> **Guidelines**
> 
> * **Replace Spells** that do not exist in the _Basic Rules_ with those that do.
> 
> * **Reflavor Magical Effects** as martial techniques or feats of skill.
> 
> * **Provide Context** for where your abilities come from in this setting.


#### Example: War Domain

The Cleric War domain can be repurposed with minor changes to its spell list. Note that the replacement spells have a theme close to their originals. Should the player wish, they might add the [Giant](../languages/secret#secret-languages) secret language to starting proficiencies for roleplaying effect.

| Cleric Level |                                                                 Spells |
| :----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 1st          |        [Cure Wounds](../../../srd_spells/cure_wounds), Shield of Faith |
| 3rd          |                                         Magic Weapon, Spiritual Weapon |
| 5th          | [Beacon of Hope](../../../srd_spells/beacon_of_hope), Spirit Guardians |
| 7th          |                                         Freedom of Movement, Stoneskin |
| 9th          |   Flame Strike, [Dominate Person](../../../srd_spells/dominate_person) |

#### Example: Rune Knight

The Fighter Rune Knight archetype can be themed as a warrior or scholar seeking out fragments of the (largely lost to time) [Giant](../languages/secret#secret-languages) language. They may have an adversarial relationship with the [Stone Legionnaires](../../../archetypes/cleric_stone) as presumed plunderers of knowledge typically reserved for initiates.

In terms of mechanics, the Rune Knight archetype is largely compatible as-is, but a Game Master might remove the size increase ability to avoid veering into high fantasy.
