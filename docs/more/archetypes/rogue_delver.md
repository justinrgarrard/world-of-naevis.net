# Rogue: Delver

_The ideal adventurer, delvers are rogues that have mastered a broad array of talents for exploring deadly dungeons. They are experts in the use of scrolls, tools, and other artifice._

#### Clever Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to drink a potion, shove a creature, or take the **Use an Object** action. 


#### Savvy
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one tool, language, and skill of your choice. Additionally, you can use any spell scroll of a level equal to or less than your proficiency bonus, as though it were of a spell you could cast. Your spellcasting modifier is Charisma where applicable.


#### Uncanny Luck
Starting at 9th level, you have resistance to damage from traps, falling, and poison. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.


#### Use Mystic Device
At 13th level, the number of items you can attune to increases by one.


#### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.
