# Cleric: Hell Knight

_Anarchists and revolutionaries, Hell Knights are devotees of chaos that aggressively seek to overturn order. The best of them seek out unjust systems to destroy, while others simply revel in destruction. They are widely shunned in settled lands, finding work among criminals and rebels._
