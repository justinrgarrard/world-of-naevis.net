# Sentient Weapons

Sentient weapons, as the name suggests, are magical weapons possessed of some awareness. Like [charms](../../gear/charms), the wielder must form a [mental bond](../../adventuring/attunement) to effectively use a sentient weapon.

Unlike charms, sentient weapons have personalities. They are generally primitive and emotional entities with a narrow set of interests. Should their wielder act against their interests, they may rebel by deactivating magic properties or even attempting to possess the user.

#### Characteristics

* **Martial**: All sentient weapons are [martial weapons](../../character_creation/class/fighter).

* **Attunement**: All sentient weapons require [attunement](../../adventuring/attunement).

* **Magical**: All sentient weapons bypass damage resistance.

* **Multi-Purpose**: All sentient weapons have non-combat applications.


#### Rapport

Sentient weapons are possessed of a personality. Should they become dissatisfied with their wielder they will rebel. For minor disagreements, this takes the form of willingly disabling their magical benefits. In more dire situations, the weapon will attempt to possess its wielder.

{: .note}
> **Possession**
>
> If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again until the next dawn.
