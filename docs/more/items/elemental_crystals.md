# Elemental Crystals

Navean elementals are magical constructs crafted by [City Dwellers](../../lore/city_dwellers/index). Their cores consist of a cut gemstone etched with countless geometric sigils by a master craftsman. An elemental forms around the core when it is submerged in the appropriate element. They are considered major weapons of war among City Dwellers and see use when defending settlements from raids.
