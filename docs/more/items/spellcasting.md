#### Descriptions

{: .mundane-item}
> **Arcane Focus, Wand**
>
> An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Glass Pearl**
>
> A glass gem used as a cheaper alternative to a true pearl. Can be used as a material component for the _Identify_ spell despite having a value less than 100 gp.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Holy Symbol, Amulet or Shield**
>
> A holy symbol is a representation of membership in a [mystery cult](../../character_creation/class/cleric).
>
> A cleric can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Robes**
>
> A set of cloth robes.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Spellbook**
>
> Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Spell Scroll (1st Level)**
>
> A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost. 
> 
> If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
> 
> Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.
>
> A spell cast from this scroll has a save DC of **13** and an attack bonus of **+5**.
