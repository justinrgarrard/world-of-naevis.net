# Feats

In Naevis, feats allow characters to gain abilities outside of their class. In addition to other benefits, taking a feat allows characters to multiclass at future levels should the player choose to do so.

##### Multiclassing

> 1. **Prerequisite**: Characters must take a multiclassing feat before they can take their first level in a new class.
> 
> 2. **Redundancy**: A feat's benefits are replaced when the character gains their first level in a new class.
> 
> 3. **Benefits**: Characters gain all the proficiencies that a new class would provide at level 1. These include proficiencies for skills, equipment, and ability saves. If a class provides spellcasting, it does not stack with other class spellcasting progressions. The two provide separate spell slots.
