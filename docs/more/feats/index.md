# Feats

In Naevis, feats allow characters to gain abilities outside of their class. In addition to other benefits, taking a feat allows characters to multiclass at future levels should the player choose to do so.

#### Multiclassing

1. **Prerequisite**: Characters must take a multiclassing feat before they can take their first level in a new class.

2. **Redundancy**: A feat's benefits are replaced when the character gains their first level in a new class.

3. **Benefits**: Characters gain all the proficiencies that a new class would provide at level 1. These include proficiencies for skills, equipment, and ability saves. If a class provides spellcasting, it does not stack with other class spellcasting progressions. The two provide separate spell slots.

<!-- Feats are the result of training in disciplines outside of one's own class. Adventurers can choose between taking a feat or an ability score increase at level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. Fighters gain bonus feats at levels 6 and 14.

#### Multiclassing

Multiclassing in Naevis is handled through [specialized feats](multiclassing). Adventurers must take a multiclassing feat **before** taking the first level of a new class.

{: .note}
> **Human Versatility**
>
> [Certain Humans](../../character_creation/race/human) gain a feat at level one. This makes them the only race capable of multiclassing before level 5. -->
