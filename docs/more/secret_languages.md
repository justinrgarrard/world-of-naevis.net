# Secret Languages

#### Words of Power

Secret languages are languages with magic imbued into their very words. They are capable of producing supernatural effects without the use of spells. Note that **secret languages cannot be acquired by normal means.** Features that provide proficiency in a language do not provide proficiency in a secret language.

##### **Abyssal**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Abyssal (Grave Speech)**
> 
> The secret language of the dead. Proficiency allows the user to communicate with undead, even commanding the attention of barely aware creatures like zombies or skeletons. [Hell Knights](../../data/archetypes/cleric_hell) use this language when casting spells.

##### **Deep Speech**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Deep Speech (Telepathy)**
> 
> The secret language of psychics. Proficiency allows the user to telepathically send words, emotions, or images to a creature up to 60 feet away. [Dreamweavers](../../data/archetypes/cleric_dream) use this language when casting spells.

##### **Giant**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Giant (Rune Carving)**
> 
> The secret language of a mythical race. Proficiency in this language teaches the two fundamental runes. Carving "steadfast" into an object makes it harder to break, while carving "falter" into an object makes it more brittle. [Stone Legionnaires](../../data/archetypes/cleric_stone) use this language when casting spells.

##### **Sylvan**

{: .exotic-language}
> **Sylvan (Beast Speech)**
> 
> The secret language of a mythical race. Proficiency allows the user to speak to and understand beasts. Whether or not the beasts choose to listen is a different matter, often influenced by a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. [Winter Witches](../../data/archetypes/cleric_winter) use this language when casting spells.

<!-- #### **Draconic**

The secret language of [wizardry](../../character_creation/class/wizard). Arcane spells with a verbal component use this language, as do most spell scrolls.  Unlike other secret languages, it has no innate magical properties, and can only be learned by taking a level in the Wizard class. -->
