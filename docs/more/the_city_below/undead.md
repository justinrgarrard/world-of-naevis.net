# Undead

#### Overview

> One of the few overlapping creatures between the City and the surface. Undead begin their second lives as ghosts, unthinking aggregations of negative energy in places of death or misery.
>
> Ghosts that manage to kill a living creature will possess its corpse. As they grow in strength they are reclassified as demons, learning to shape their flesh into new forms. Vampires, ghouls, and succubi are all variants of undead that have changed their bodies for a specific method of hunting.

#### Settlements

> Weak undead are most common in abandoned areas where no priests or shamans might pass by. More powerful undead will venture to the fringes of societies in order to secure food. A small number may create [demon worshipping cults](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_demon) for the same reasons.

#### Disposition

> Undead are defined by their destructive nature. They do not possess a capacity for kindness or honor. Some, particularly vampires, can skillfully impersonate virtues despite an inability to understand them. Undead are universally driven by a desire to consume life.
