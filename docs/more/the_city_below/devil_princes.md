# The Nine Devil Princes

#### Overview

> Reports of the Devil Princes are tinged with awe, fear, and religious reverence. City Dwellers describe them as immortals from the dawn of time, capable of great and terrible magic, the most well-known of which is shapeshifting. Folk tales tell of a Prince who took the form of a swarm of beetles to listen to every word of heresy spoken in a village before punishing them exactly to the degree that they sinned. Another myth describes a Prince who became a mass of floating eyes and turned an entire city to stone.

#### Disposition

> Reports of the Princes' mentalities vary greatly. Some legends have them behaving much like mortals. They take paramours, they revenge themselves on enemies (usually their siblings), and they are occasionally moved to generosity. Other legends portray them as inscrutable beings whose alien mindset is incomprehensible even to their own worshippers.

#### Existence

> Surface dwellers to-date have not encountered any of the Devil Princes. The prevailing view among scholars is that they are simply a fiction invented by primitive City creatures.

***Berith***

> _One of the nine mythical Devil Princes. Berith is described as a towering giant, a cloud of flies, and a floating torso the size of a building. Its followers revere it with equal parts fanatical devotion and fear. Of the Princes, Berith has a reputation for being the most strict about adherence to laws and rules. It is capable of casting any spell of fifth level or lower without restrictions, and may use higher level spells sparingly._
