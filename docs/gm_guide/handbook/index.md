#### How To Run Naevis

Running Naevis isn't significantly different from running any other 5E game. Game Masters invest a reasonable amount of time in prep work before game day (~2 hours). Then, they leverage that prep work alongside improvisations while running the session.

1. **[Build a Dungeon](../toolbox/dungeons/index)**
2. **React to Players**
3. **Preserve Momentum**

##### Prepping a Dungeon

> The first step in running a session is building a repertoire of [Rooms](../toolbox/dungeons/index#concept-the-room) that you can draw on during play. These will encompass everything from combat encounters to locked doors.

##### Improvisation

> The second and third steps relate to the "flow" of a session. You introduce players to Rooms as they enter, then allow them to react. If they become stuck, you introduce new circumstances that force them to act.

#### Genre

In many ways, Naevis is closer to _The Oregon Trail_ than _Diablo_.

Where 5E typically involves world-bending sorceries and scheming deities, games set in this world take place closer to the ground. There are fewer problems that can be solved with a spell or magic sword. Healing is harder to come by. And something as minor as a curse can prove fatal. As you run sessions, try to keep the following in mind:

##### Player Skill > Character Builds

> Sessions are not a test of how well-optimized a character is. They are about creative problem solving that leverages a character's abilities. 

##### Tactics

> Fair fights get adventurers killed. Set the expectation (gently at first) that going toe-to-toe with monsters without a plan will end badly.

##### Low Fantasy, Not Grimdark Fantasy

> There's a balance to be struck between "challenging resource scarcity" and "arbitrary sadism". Present reasonable challenges to your players by signaling when danger is afoot.
