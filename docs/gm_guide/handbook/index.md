#### How To Run Naevis

Running Naevis isn't significantly different from running any other 5E game. Game Masters invest a reasonable amount of time in prep work before play (~2 hours). Then, they leverage that prep work alongside improvisations while running the session.

1. **Build a Dungeon**
2. **React to Players**
3. **Preserve Momentum**


##### Tools and Techniques

> Naevis comes with a collection of optional tools designed to help with prep work.
