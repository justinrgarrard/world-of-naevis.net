# Expectations

#### Setting Player Expectations

Before rolling any dice or creating any characters, you must sit down with your players and describe the type of game this supplement is designed to run.

{: .note}
> **Dungeon Crawl:** A tactical, resource-based survival game. Characters are typically between levels 1-10 and rely on their wits, rather than raw power, to succeed.

##### Optimization

> Veteran 5E players have a tendency to plan out their character's build well in advance. Some may find the *Basic Rules* options to be unsatisfying. Should this be the case, try redirecting the player's interest in optimization towards level 1 builds, emphasizing the challenge of combining race, class, and backgrounds to create interesting concepts. For example:
> 
> * An armored Mountain Dwarf Wizard that fights with a battleaxe.
> * A Human "Paladin" that uses feats to combine the Fighter class with Cleric cantrips.
> * A Halfling wandslinger that combines high charisma with an [Ash Wand](../../../data/magic_items/ash_wand) to gain item-based magic.

**DON'T**...

* Start campaigns at level 3.

* Allow combat to go for longer than 3 rounds.
* Portray the players' characters as bumbling or ineffectual.
