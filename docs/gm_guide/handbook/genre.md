#### Setting the Mood

Dungeons and Dragons 5E can be used to run many different types of games. The _Forgotten Realms_ setting favors High Fantasy, with powerful gods and nigh-immortal wizards shaping every adventure. _Eberron_ provides a Noir/Pulp Action world with Dragonmarked Houses scheming against the backdrop of a world war. _Ravenloft_ leans towards Fantasy Horror by presenting unsettling sights at every turn.

Naevis, for its part, is intended for **Survival Fantasy** games. It has as much in common with the _Oregon Trail_ series as it does with _Skyrim_ or _Diablo_. Sessions should have players thumbing their chin as they weigh their options.
