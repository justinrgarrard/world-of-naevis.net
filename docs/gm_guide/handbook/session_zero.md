# Session Zero

#### Setting Expectations

Many tables are used to a certain style of play with 5E. Specifically, games which place a high degree of importance on system mastery and character customization. This tendency expresses itself in highly elaborate characters. 

This is by no means a "bad" or "incorrect" way to play. But it is decidedly different from the games that Naevis is designed to run. Character options are deliberately restricted in part to move away from the [Fantasy Kitchen Sink](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink) worlds that this style of play creates, as well as from gameplay that focuses on class features more than player ingenuity.

Before rolling any dice or creating any characters, you should sit down with your players and have a [Session Zero](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/929-how-to-run-a-session-0-for-your-d-d-game#Setting_and_Managing_Expectations) to discuss expectations.

> ##### Selling "Less is More" To Players
>
> A good number of 5E players will be dismayed upon hearing that their character choices are restricted. Some will be inconsolable, and will bow out of the campaign before play. But many others are willing to be convinced should you have a strong enough pitch.
>
> * **Allude to Other Media**: Relate the campaign setting to _Game of Thrones_, _Lord of the Rings_, or other popular fantasy series with a similar genre.
>
> * **Emphasize Novelty**: For veteran players, frame Naevis as a different way to enjoy the same game. Highlight the challenge of building a character optimized for low-level play.
>
> * **Spark the Imagination**: For players who enjoy roleplay over mechanical tuning, direct them towards the [Character Generator Tool](../../character_creation/index#quickstart). Let them explore the relationship between a character's race, class, and social standing.
