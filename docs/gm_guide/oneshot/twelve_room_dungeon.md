# The Twelve Room Dungeon Dive

#### Making Spaces

Your first task is to create twelve **Rooms**, locations that have some form of challenge or interesting feature. These rooms will act as "cards" that you can play or hold as the players advance.

Your job is to use these cards in an order that provides good momentum. If one room is a combat encounter, the next should be something different, like an obstacle. This provides good variety to the players and keeps them engaged.

You should continue playing rooms until roughly 1.5 hours have passed. Then, you should move players into a finale, such as a boss fight or imminent crisis.

> It's easier to remove material on the fly than it is to improvise. With twelve rooms, you are unlikely to run out of content. Any unused rooms can be stashed away for a future session.

<!-- #### Trimming Rooms

Most sessions will not use all twelve rooms. Instead, silently trim out rooms throughout the game to ensure that the session has good pacing. If the players spend an unexpectedly long time on combat, consider removing the next Threat room. Similarly, introduce Threats if players spend overly long on an Oddity. -->
