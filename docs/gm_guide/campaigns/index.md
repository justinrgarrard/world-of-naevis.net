# Campaigns

#### The Long Haul

Campaigns are longer form games, typically consisting of [10 or more sessions](leveling_tables) conducted over months of real world time. They allow players to grow their characters and interact with the world more thoroughly than in a oneshot.

#### Dungeon a Day

Campaigns in Naevis are designed to be run as a series of standalone adventures, each self contained. Today's dungeon might be an undead infested library, next week's could be a negotiation between two rival orc clans. This structure provides the following benefits:

* **Flexible Scheduling**: Players can drop-in or drop-out throughout a campaign.
* **Character Rosters**: Players have the freedom to try out new characters each session if they so decide.
* **Character Growth**: Players that stick with a specific character are rewarded with gradually increasing wealth, equipment, and roleplaying opportunities.

> A module-like approach might be preferred at some tables. In these campaigns, players spend multiple sessions exploring a single dungeon (typically one [generated in full](https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/dungeon/).)
