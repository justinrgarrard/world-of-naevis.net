# GM Guide

#### What This Section Is About

The role of running games (called "Dungeon Master", "Game Master", and many other things) is covered widely across many resources. Preliminary information can be found in the [Basic Rules](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf) and the [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2014). A [wider collection](handbook/recommended_reading) of tips and tricks can be found on dedicated blogs and within officially published material.

This section will not attempt to cover the entirety of Game Mastering know-how. Instead, it will offer guidance for evoking the **Survival Adventure** genre.
