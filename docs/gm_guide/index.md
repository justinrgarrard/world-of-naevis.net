# GM Guide

#### What This Section Is About

The role of running games (called "Dungeon Master", "Game Master", and many other things) is covered widely across many resources. Preliminary information can be found in the [Basic Rules](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). A [wider collection](recommended_reading) of tips and tricks can be found on dedicated blogs and within officially published material.

This section will not attempt to cover the entirety of Game Mastering know-how. Instead, it will offer a few general tricks to help in evoking the **Survival Adventure** genre.
