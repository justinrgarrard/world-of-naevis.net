# Bosses

Boss fights are more challenging encounters intended to threaten parties. They should be very difficult to win without some form of tactics.

#### Running Bosses

* **Multiple Initiatives**: Bosses attack multiple times each round, spread out between player actions.

* **Death Saving Throws**: Bosses get death saves, unless their stat block says otherwise (i.e. creatures that self-destruct). This allows players some roleplaying opportunities.

* **Superior Stats**: Bosses typically have a +4 to hit, a 14 AC, and a +4 to all saves. GM's may adjust this where appropriate (such as making a very strong, but easily fooled, minotaur).

* **Scaling Hit Points**: The number of hit points a boss has depends on the number of players participating. A good rule of thumb is (25 + 10 per player).

* **High Lethality**: Boss creatures deal a large, flat amount of damage each attack. Typically, this amount is just short of enough to kill a low-level player character. High damage attacks reinforce the danger involved, keeps fights short, and encourages players to strategize.

* **Multiple Stages**: Boss creatures change their behavior throughout the fight. They may attempt to surrender at a certain percentage of health, gain more turns each round, or introduce new attacks.

{: .note}
> **Why +4?**
>
> Readers will notice that many of the boss creature's statistics revolve around the number 4.
> 
> In 5E, most values operate around a d20 system where each "step" loosely represents a 5% change. Within this framework, a +4 roughly corresponds to a 20% increase in something.
>
> For example, someone with a +4 to hit is about 20% more likely to land a hit than someone with a +0. A +4 to dexterity translates to about a 20% increase in chance of success for making a dexterity save. A boss creature, then, is about 20% better at everything than a creature with no remarkable stats.
>
> **GM's can scale boss monsters on the fly by changing their modifier from +4.** A tougher boss might have a +6 stat base, while a weaker boss could go as low as +2.
