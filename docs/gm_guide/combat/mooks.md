# Mooks

**Mooks** are generic enemies with a single hit point and a gimmick. They typically appear in groups of 3 to 6, and are vulnerable to crowd control effects like _Sleep_. Game Masters can use Mooks as filler enemies meant to be taken out with one attack.

#### Running Mooks

* **Shared Initiative**: Mooks form groups of three and share initiatives. You might consider assigning (rather rolling) initiatives such that no more than one group of mooks acts between player turns.

* **Attacking**: All Mooks in a group target the same creature when attacking. Roll for each Mook (d20 + 0), then multiply the number of successes by 4 to get the damage. Don't roll individual damage for Mooks.

* **Defending**: A successful hit incapacitates a Mook. A critical hit incapacitates two Mooks. Damaged groups will attempt to reform full groups by merging with other damaged groups.

* **Morale**: If they appear to be losing the fight, most Mooks will retreat.


#### Buffing Mooks

* **Accurate**: Has a +4 to hit, instead of a +0.

* **Ethereal**: Cannot be damaged by non-magical weapons.

* **Poisonous**: Successful attacks cause a DC 10 Constitution save, inflicting one hour of Poisoned on fail.

* **Sleepproof**: Cannot be affected by the _Sleep_ spell.

* **Fireproof**: Cannot be affected by fire damage, rendering them immune to the _Burning Hands_ spell.
