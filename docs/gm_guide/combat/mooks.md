# Mooks

#### The Generic Bad Guy

Mooks are generic enemies with a single hit point. They are typically used in groups of 3 and have no modifiers to their ability scores or attacks.

>
> * Give them a ranged attack.
> * Give them a special ability.
> * Increase their AC to 15.
> * Increase their attack bonus to +4 and damage to 6 (1d10).
> * Make them immune to non-magical weapons.

#### Running Mooks

* **Shared Initiative**: Mooks form groups of three and share initiatives. You might consider assigning (rather rolling) initiatives such that no more than one group of mooks acts between player turns.

* **Attacking**: All Mooks in a group target the same creature when attacking. Roll for each Mook (d20 + 0), then multiply the number of successes by 4 to get the damage. Don't roll individual damage for Mooks.

* **Defending**: A successful hit incapacitates a Mook. A critical hit incapacitates two Mooks. Damaged groups will attempt to reform full groups by merging with other damaged groups.

* **Morale**: If they appear to be losing the fight, most Mooks will retreat.


#### Buffing Mooks

* **Accurate**: Has a +4 to hit, instead of a +0.

* **Ethereal**: Cannot be damaged by non-magical weapons.

* **Poisonous**: Successful attacks cause a DC 10 Constitution save, inflicting one hour of Poisoned on fail.

* **Sleepproof**: Cannot be affected by the _Sleep_ spell.

* **Fireproof**: Cannot be affected by fire damage, rendering them immune to the _Burning Hands_ spell. -->
