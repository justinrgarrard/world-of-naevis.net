# Combat

#### Tips

Combat scenarios can be difficult to run for even the most experienced Game Masters. A few guidelines are offered below:

* **Keep it Fast**: Typically, combat should go for no longer than three rounds. 

* **Keep it Lethal**: Most [non-boss enemies](mooks) should die in a single hit (1 HP). Conversely, their attacks should deal a flat amount of damage to avoid bogging down fights with excessive dice rolls.

* **Keep it Interesting**: Each encounter should have a "gimmick" of some kind. For instance, a skirmish against Giant Bats might have the bats taking a free disengage on their turns to stay out of melee range.

#### Things to Avoid

**Bags of Hit Points**

> Enemies that soak up damage and behave predictably are boring. Combat should not devolve into chipping away at one another's health. Give the monsters tactics and motivations. When a fight does devolve, introduce complications to keep things interesting (tunnel begins flooding with lava, bigger monster eats the boring monsters, a glowing artifact is revealed and both parties scramble to get it first).

**Mop Up Fights**

> Enemies that no longer pose a threat to players are boring. When a fight goes past the point where creatures present a credible danger, wrap it up. Have the enemies flee, or hand-waive the remainder of the skirmish by saying, "You slay the last remaining zombies without issue."

**Godzilla**

> If your big-bad gets one move for every five player moves, the fight will be boring. Give them multiple initiatives. Have them abruptly change tactics at half HP. Make them self-destruct when near death. Whatever approach you choose, make sure that it keeps the players on their toes.

**Legendary Resistances**

> Having player abilities be negated by limited-use fiat is boring. Use more inventive systems to make enemies tough.
> * Give your monster immunity to non-magical weapons and place a visibly cursed sword nearby.
> * Add "success with consequences" by making zombies take more damage from fire, but transform into more dangerous flamming zombies when struck.
