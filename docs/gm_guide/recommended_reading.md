> **Conflicting Advice**
>
> Best practice for running games is a highly divisive topic. Every game is liable to have its own recommendations for play. Indeed, even settings within games (such as *Naevis*, the _Forgotten Realms_, and _Eberron_) have their own recommendations for how to run sessions. Part of the fun of being a Game Master is developing your own personal style and approach by trying many different strategies and seeing which ones work best for you.
