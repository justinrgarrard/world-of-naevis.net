# Expectations

#### Setting Player Expectations

Before rolling any dice or creating any characters, you must sit down with your players and describe the type of game this supplement is designed to run.

{: .note}
> **Dungeon Crawl:** A tactical, resource-based survival game. Characters are typically between levels 1-5 and rely on their wits, rather than raw power, to succeed.

##### Optimization

> Veteran 5E players have a tendency to plan out their character's build well in advance. Some may find the *Basic Rules* options to be unsatisfying. Should this be the case, try redirecting the player's interest in optimization towards level 1 builds, emphasizing the challenge of combining race, class, and backgrounds to create interesting concepts. For example:
> 
> * An armored Mountain Dwarf Wizard that fights with a battleaxe.
> * A Human "Paladin" that uses [feats](../more/feats/index) to combine the Fighter class with Cleric cantrips.
> * A Halfling wandslinger that combines high charisma with an [Ash Wand](../../data/magic_items/ash_wand) to gain item-based magic.

#### Setting GM Expectations

Equally important, you (the GM), need to have an understanding of the games that Naevis is intended to run. The setting borrows heavily from [OSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance#Style_of_play) principles. A few of the most important are listed below:

##### Player Skill > Character Builds

> Sessions are not a test of how well-optimized a character is. They are about creative problem solving that leverages a character's abilities. 

##### Tactics

> Fair fights get adventurers killed. Set the expectation (gently at first) that going toe-to-toe with monsters without a plan will end badly. 

##### Yes, And...

> While you shouldn't be afraid to tell your players no when they try to do something impossible, you should always try to work with their attempts.

#### Do's and Don'ts

**DO**... 

* Start campaigns at level 1.
* Encourage creative solutions to problems.
* Keep combat short and lethal.
* Be a fan of the players' characters.
* Signal when there's danger in an area.

**DON'T**...

* Start campaigns at level 3.
* Use "only one correct solution" scenarios.
* Allow combat to go for longer than 3 rounds.
* Portray the players' characters as bumbling or ineffectual.
* Spring traps or hazards that don't allow the players at least one chance to react.
