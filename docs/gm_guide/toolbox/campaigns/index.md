# Campaigns

#### The Long Haul

Campaigns are longer form games, typically consisting of [10 or more sessions](../tables/leveling_tables) conducted over months of real world time. They allow players to grow their characters and interact with the world more thoroughly than in a oneshot.

##### Primary Option: Dungeon a Day

> Campaigns in Naevis are designed to be run as a series of standalone adventures, each self contained. Today's dungeon might be an undead infested library, next week's could be a negotiation between two rival orc clans. This structure provides the following benefits:
> 
> * **Flexible Scheduling**: Players can drop-in or drop-out throughout a campaign.
> * **Character Rosters**: Players have the freedom to try out new characters each session if they so decide.
> * **Character Growth**: Players that stick with a specific character are rewarded with gradually increasing wealth, equipment, and roleplaying opportunities.

> ##### Alternative Option: Multi-Session Dungeons
>
> A module-like approach might be preferred at some tables. In these campaigns, players spend multiple sessions exploring a single dungeon (typically one [generated in full](https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/dungeon/).) This structure provides the following benefits:
> 
> * **Classic Mapmaking**: Players can be responsible for drawing their own maps of larger dungeons.
> * **Adapting Classic Modules**: Game Masters can reuse well-established dungeons like *Keep on the Borderlands*.
> * **Higher Difficulty**: Players face greater difficulties in managing their resources when trade is rare.
