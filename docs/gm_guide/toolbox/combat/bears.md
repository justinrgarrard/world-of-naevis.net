Bears are individual enemies that pose a threat to parties. Despite the name, their statblock can reflect a wide range of creatures. A giant serpent, a skilled swordsman, or a flame-spitting demon can fit this role.

##### General Usage Information

> Bears are sturdy enemies that get multiple actions per round. There is generally only one per encounter, sometimes accompanied by a [swarm](swarms). They are more accurate, deal more damage, and can sustain more damage than swarms.
>
> From the player perspective, bears are targets to focus fire on. These encounters usually bait players into expending "once per short rest" abilities and spell slots. 

##### Running Bears

> * **Two Initiatives**: Bears act twice each round, usually at initiative 15 and 5.
>
> * **Two Attacks**: Use different attacks for each initiative.
> 
> * **Tactics Change**: Change behavior at half HP. Have them attempt to flee, plead for their life, or use a special ability.

##### Enhancing Bears

> To make a bear stronger, consider adding one of the following:
>
> *Defense*
> * **Resistant**: Half damage from non-magical weapons.
> * **Tough**: Add +10 HP (~2 hits).
> * **Magic Resistance**: Half damage from fire, cold, acid, and lighting attacks.
> * **Beefy**: Add +4 to physical saves, subtract -2 from mental saves.
> * **Magical**: Add +2 to mental saves.
>
> *Offense*
> * **Rider**: Add a DC 15 save vs. condition on successful attacks (poison, knockdown, frightened).
> * **Ranged Option**: Gain a ranged attack, such as _Fire bolt_ or a bow.
> * **Armor Piercing**: Gain a special attack that damages player characters when they fail a saving throw (WIS, DEX, etc.)
> * **Spell**: Gain a spell that can be used once per fight.
