Bosses are powerful enemies that require the party to use all or most of their available resources to defeat. Not every dungeon has a boss, but those that do typically only have one.

##### Designing a Boss Fight

> In general, boss fights can use the [bear](bears) template with enhancements. Many standard 5E statblocks can also be used as bosses. Remember that the [three round combat](index) rule is still in effect. Standard statblocks need to be appropriately lethal to drive a conclusion.
>
> From the player perspective, a boss fight is the time to use all remaining items and spells. When it's present (and it [won't always be](#alternatives-to-boss-fights)), it should serve as a high-stakes finale to the dungeon crawl.


##### Running a Boss Fight

> * **Death Saving Throws**: Bosses get death saves, unless their stat block says otherwise (i.e. creatures that self-destruct). This allows players some roleplaying opportunities.
>
> * **No Legendary Resistances**: In general, avoid abilities that negate player actions through fiat. Instead, when a boss would be stunned or similarly impaired, have the boss lose one of their initiatives in combat.
>
> * **Minions**: Most bosses are accompanied by [swarms](swarms).


{: .note}
> **(Optional) Not Even My Final Form**
>
> Boss fights can be a delicate balancing act between "overpowering the party that ran out of resources" and "obliterated by a party that carefully rationed their spells". A good way to mitigate this is by dividing a boss into three stages.
>
> 1. `100% HP -> 50% HP` Standard Fight
>
> 2. `50% HP -> 0% HP` Desperate Fight
>
> 3. `0% HP -> -50% HP` Optional Secret Fight
>
> Build your bosses to have a third stage that only triggers if the party has too easy of a time with the first two. Give the third stage an extra 50% of the boss' HP and a dangerous new ability.

#### Alternatives to Boss Fights

Not every dungeon has a big boss waiting in the last room. Many are setup in a way that a boss fight is unnecessary, or handled in a different fashion. Below are a few examples.

> * **Too Strong**: Sometimes the "boss" is creature that's too powerful to fight, such as an ancient dragon, and instead needs to treated like a [Hazard](../../dungeons/index#hazard).
>
> * **Different Finale**: Sometimes the last "boss" is actually a cave-in, flood, or other trial that is equally dangerous but can't be handled through combat.
>
> * **Hidden Danger**: Sometimes the party survives a harrowing dungeon by the skin of their teeth, only to be confronted by bandits waiting at the entrance for easy pickings.
