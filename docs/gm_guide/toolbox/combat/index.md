# Combat

#### Preventing Boring Fights

Combat is a large part of the 5E system, and of dungeon crawling as a whole. But without special care, it can devolve into laborious dogfight. The tools in this section are designed to prevent combat [failure states](failure_states).

> ##### Prelude to Combat
> 
> In almost every situation, players should be given **one chance** to avoid an impending combat situation. Describe the orcs closing in before declaring initiative. Allow them to try their hand at a distraction, or diplomacy, or something else altogether. And if they fail, move into combat.
