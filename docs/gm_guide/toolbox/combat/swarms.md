A Swarm is a collection of enemies who make up for their weakness with numbers. Examples might include a group of goblins or a pack of wolves.

##### General Usage Information

> Swarms are designed for ease of use. By default, they have no modifiers to remember, deal a flat amount of damage, and are taken out in one hit. They are also surprisingly lethal when targeting a single player character.
>
> From the player perspective, swarms are indistinguishable from a large group of weak enemies. They are especially vulnerable to spells like _Burning Hands_ and _Sleep_. This is intentional, and encourages parties to burn valuable spell slots.

##### Running Swarms

> * **Shared Initiative**: Do not roll initiative for the group. Give them a flat value, such as 15, 10, or 5.
> 
> * **Health**: Do not track hit points. When the group takes damage, kill one of its members. If a player scores a critical hit, kill two.
> 
> * **Dogpile**: When the group attacks, have them target the same character. Roll a number of times equal to the number of creatures in the group.
>
> * **Morale**: If they appear to be losing, most swarms will retreat.

##### Enhancing Swarms

> To make a swarm stronger, consider adding one of the following:
>
> *Defense*
> * **Sleepproof**: Immunity to the _Sleep_ spell.
> * **Fireproof**: Immunity to fire damage, such as from the _Burning Hands_ spell.
> * **Ethereal**: Immunity to non-magical weapons.
> * **Tough**: Set the HP of individual creatures to 8 (~2 hits).
>
> *Offense*
> * **Superb Physicality**: Increase physical modifiers and damage by +2, +4, or +6.
> * **Rider**: Add a DC 15 save vs. condition on successful attacks (poison, knockdown, frightened).
> * **Ranged Option**: Gain a ranged attack, such as _Fire bolt_ or a bow.
> * **Armor Piercing**: Gain a special attack that damages player characters when they fail a saving throw (WIS, DEX, etc.)
