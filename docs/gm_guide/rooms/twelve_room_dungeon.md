# The Twelve Room Dungeon Dive

#### Making a Dungeon

Create twelve **Rooms** that encompass a variety of threats, hazards, and oddities. These rooms will act as "cards" that you can play or hold as the players advance.

Use these cards in an order that provides good momentum. If one room is a combat encounter, the next should be something different, like an obstacle. This provides good variety to the players and keeps them engaged.

After ~2 hours, direct the players to the finale (even if you have unused rooms).

> It's easier to remove material on the fly than it is to improvise. With twelve rooms, you are unlikely to run out of content. Any unused rooms can be stashed away for a future session.
