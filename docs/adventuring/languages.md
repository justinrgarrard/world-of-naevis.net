# Languages

#### The Common Tongue

{: .language}
> **Common**, the human tongue, is widely used as the language of trade and diplomacy. All adventurers are proficient in Common.

All adventurers are proficient in Common, but many non-playable characters are not. Isolated halfling tribes, elitist elves, and City Dwellers may require other languages to communicate with.

#### City Dweller Languages

{: .language}
> **Undercommon**, the verbal language of the City Below. This language is required for verbal communication with orcs, kobolds, and any other speaking race in the City.

{: .language}
> **Infernal**, the written language of the City Below. Books, warning signs, and other textual information found underground are written in this language.

The spoken and written languages used by City Dwellers are treated as two separate proficiencies. While neither language has been fully mastered by the surface races, plenty of adventurers have learned enough to get by.


#### Racial Languages

{: .language}
> **Dwarven** is the language of industry. Nearly all schematics, blueprints, and architectural diagrams are written in Dwarven. Proficient characters receive a **20% discount when buying weapons and armor**.

{: .language}
> **Elven** is the language of enchanting. Proficient characters receive a **20% discount when buying spellbooks, spellcasting focuses, and scrolls**.

{: .language}
> **Halfling** is the language of alchemy. Nearly all recipes are written in the language and use the halfling measurement system. Proficient characters receive a **20% discount when buying alchemics, like potions**.

Racial languages provide discounts on certain categories of items and typically result in easier communication.
