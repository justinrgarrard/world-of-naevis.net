# Encumbrance

#### Managing Weight

An adventurer's Strength score determines how many pounds they can shoulder without penalty. Every point of strength changes the thresholds by 5 (per the _Basic Rules_ variant encumbrance system).

| Strength | Slowed | Disadvantage | Immobile |
| :------- | -----: | -----------: | -------: |
| 8        |     40 |           80 |      120 |
| 10       |     50 |          100 |      150 |
| 12       |     60 |          120 |      180 |
| 14       |     70 |          140 |      210 |
| 16       |     80 |          160 |      240 |
| 18       |     90 |          180 |      270 |

**Slowed**: Movement speed is reduced by 10 feet.

**Disadvantage**: Movement speed is reduced by 20 feet, and rolls that depend on Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution are made at disadvantage.

**Immobile**: You are unable to move.

#### Containers

An adventurer's carrying capacity is also limited by the containers they use. 

* A [Backpack](../gear/index) can hold 30 lb. but is hard to access during a fight.
* A [Pouch](../gear/index) can hold 6 lb. and is easy to access during a fight.
* Items that are worn or carried (armor, weapons, etc.) do not need to be stored in a container.

> **Review: Jumping**
>
> * ***Long Jump***. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.
>
> * ***High Jump***. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.  -->

<!-- > * ***Push, Drag, or Lift***. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to 30 times your Strength score. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of 15 times your Strength score, your speed drops to 5 feet.

> **Review: Variant Encumbrance**
>
> _The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5._
> 
> _If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet._
> 
> _If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution._
