# Encumbrance

#### Managing Weight

An adventurer's Strength score determines how many pounds they can shoulder without penalty. 

| Strength | Slowed | Disadvantage | Immobile |
| :------- | -----: | -----------: | -------: |
| 8        |     40 |           80 |      120 |
| 10       |     50 |          100 |      150 |
| 12       |     60 |          120 |      180 |
| 14       |     70 |          140 |      210 |
| 16       |     80 |          160 |      240 |
| 18       |     90 |          180 |      270 |

##### Penalties

> * **Slowed**: Movement speed is reduced by 10 feet.
> * **Disadvantage**: Movement speed is reduced by 20 feet, and rolls that depend on Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution are made at disadvantage.
> * **Immobile**: You are unable to move, gaining the [Restrained](../../more/review/conditions#restrained) condition.

#### Loot

{: .mundane-item}
> **Loot (25 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 5 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.

With the exception of magic items, most forms of loot are valued by weight. Adventurers with a high Strength are better able to bear the encumbrance of valuables.

#### Containers

An adventurer's carrying capacity is also limited by the containers they use. 

##### Backpacks

> A [Backpack](../../../data/items/backpack) can hold 30 lb. but is hard to access during a fight, requiring adventurers to take the **Use an Object** action to interact with.

##### Pouch

> A [Pouch](../../../data/items/pouch) can hold 6 lb. and is easy to access during a fight. No actions are required to use a pouch.
