# Resting

#### Short Rests 

* **Ration**: Consumes one set of rations.
* **Time**: Requires one hour of time.
* **Safety**: Requires a (relatively) safe location free of hostiles.
* **Healing**: Consumes one or more Hit Dice to restore hit points.

#### Long Rests 

Long rests are taken **between** sessions, rather than during sessions. [Wizards](../../character_creation/class/wizard) should take particular care to ensure that they can continue to survive even if their spell slots are expended. Scrolls are a handy tool for this purpose.

> **Review: Hit Dice**
>
> Adventurers have a number of Hit Dice equal to their level. These Hit Dice can be rolled on a Short Rest to restore hit points. Hit Dice are restored on a long rest.
