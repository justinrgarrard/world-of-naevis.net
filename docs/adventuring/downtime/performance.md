# Performance

#### Earning Your Keep

Even in the Nameless Desert, taverns compete for the privilege of hosting a talented entertainer. Adventurers proficient with an instrument can spend their [downtime](index) earning gold instead of spending it.

{: .note}
> **Charisma-based**
> 
> * Waive your [Lifestyle Expenses](index#lifestyle-expenses) for this downtime. 
> 
> * Gain an amount of gp equal to: (**3d4 * Charisma Modifier**). If your Charisma modifier is less than +1, treat it as +1.
>
> * If you are proficient in the Charisma (Performance) skill, roll an additional d4 for every level of your proficiency bonus.
>
> * If you have [Expertise](../../character_creation/class/rogue#expertise) in Performance, add an additional d4.

##### Examples

> Avery is a [Nomad](../../character_creation/background/nomad) with 14 (+2) Charisma. They roll 3d4 and get a 9. Multiplying that amount by their Charisma modifier, they earn 18 gp.
>
> Maeve is a Rogue [Piper](../../character_creation/background/piper) with 15 (+2) Charisma and Expertise in Performance. She rolls 6d4 and gets an 18. Multiplying that amount by their Charisma modifier, they earn 36 gp.
>
> Both adventurers are exempt from the standard 25 gp Lifestyle Expense paid during downtime.
