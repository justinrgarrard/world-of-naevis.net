# Alchemy

#### Craft Alchemics

Navean alchemy uses mundane tools and magical ingredients to create useful items. Adventurers proficient in at least one tool can create [alchemics](../../character_creation/equipment/alchemics) during [downtime](index). They **do not** need to own a set of tools to perform their trade, instead renting tools as part of their Lifestyle Expense.

{: .note}
> **Intelligence-based**
> 
> The maximum number of items an adventurer can create in a single work session is equal to: **(Intelligence Modifier + 1)**, minimum 1.
