# Attunement

#### Magic Items

Most magic items, including [charms](../gear/charms) and [sentient weapons](../more/items/sentient_weapons), require attunement to use. An adventurer must form a mental bond with the item in order to bring out its latent powers. The number of items they can bond is dependent on their Charisma.

{: .note}
> **Charisma Limiter**
> 
> The maximum number of items an adventurer can attune to is equal to: **(Charisma Modifier + 1)**, minimum 1.

#### Identification

The attunement process can be done over a short rest, provided that the item in question is identified. This can be achieved through the _Identify_ spell or by paying 25 gp to a merchant during downtime.
