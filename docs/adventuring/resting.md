# Resting

#### The Adventuring Day

In a typical session, adventurers can expect to take between **1-3 short rests** and **no long rests**. 

#### Short Rests 

* **Ration**: Consumes one set of rations.
* **Time**: Requires one hour of time.
* **Safety**: Requires a (relatively) safe location free of hostiles.
* **Healing**: Consumes one or more Hit Dice to restore hit points.


#### Long Rests 

Long rests are taken **between** sessions, rather than during sessions. [Wizards](../character_creation/class/wizard) should take particular care to ensure that they can continue to survive even if their spell slots are expended. [Scrolls](../gear/scrolls) are a handy tool for this purpose.

{: .note}
> **Review: Hit Dice**
>
> Adventurers have a number of Hit Dice equal to their level. These Hit Dice can be rolled on a short rest to restore hit points. Hit Dice are restored on a long rest.

> **Triage Pack**
>
> A collection of splints, salves, and antivenoms. A pack can be used during a short rest by someone proficient in the medicine skill.
> 
> The pack neutralizes non-magical poisons and restores an expended hit die for up to six people. After use, it is consumed. -->
