# Adventuring

#### Dungeon Diving

Adventures in Naevis typically take the form of structured exploration. The party enters into an unexplored section of the [Forgotten City](../lore/city_below) and carefully works their way through hostile territory. Some expeditions may wind through stonehewn tunnels and the lairs of strange beasts. Others may intersect with [City Dweller](../lore/city_dwellers/index) civilizations, ranging from the vast underground libraries of the Tieflings to Orcish raiding party camps.

#### Basic Mechanics

Naevis uses the _[5E Basic Rules](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_ along with custom modifications to a handful of systems. Players and Game Masters familiar with 5E should have little trouble adapting their playstyles to the setting.
