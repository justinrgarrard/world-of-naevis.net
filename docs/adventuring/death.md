# Death

#### Let the Dice Fall

Character death is almost always permanent in _Naevis_. _Raise Dead_ and similar spells are largely myths, though the [Nine Devil Princes](../the_frontier/city_dwellers/devil_princes) may be capable of casting them (if such creatures truly exist and can be bargained with).

> Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.

#### Backfill

Adventurers may die or retire during play. When this happens, players can roll up a new character at the same level as the other members of the party. Their starting gold is equal to **100 gp + 50 gp for every level above the first**. For example, a new 3rd level Fighter would begin play with 200 gp (100 gp + 100 gp).

> Players do not need to kill off their characters if they'd like to try something different. "Retired" characters can be put on the bench while new ones are rotated in. However, **characters do not share gold.**


#### Curses

For many adventurers, a curse is little different than a forced retirement. Very few [cultists](../character_creation/class/cleric) are capable of casting the _Remove Curse_ spell and none are willing to do so for free. Expect to spend **250 gp** for such a service.
