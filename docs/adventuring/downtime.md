# Downtime

#### Hard-Earned Rest

Downtime is the time between adventures. It encompasses the activities that characters get up to when they aren't dungeon diving or otherwise in mortal danger. In game, downtime will often represent **4-6 weeks of recuperation**. 

#### Activities

The options available to a character depend on their class and proficiencies.
