# Magic

#### A Framework for Magic

> In the world of Naevis, "magic" is the term for shaping potent energies into predictable effects. It has two parts:
> 
> **Source**
>
> First, energy must be pulled from somewhere. Wizards typically draw from ley lines beneath the earth. Clerics draw from other sources, such as life energy, divine grace, or qi.
>
> **Shape**
>
> Second, the energy must be coerced into a usable form. This nearly always requires the use of a [secret language](../../more/secret_languages). Wizards use the artificial Draconic language, known for providing the greatest variety of spells. Clerics use the secret language of their cult (i.e. Giant, Sylvan, etc.) Cult languages are less expressive than Draconic, but are capable of effects that Wizards have not yet been able to replicate, including healing.


#### Words of Power

>The foundation of any spellcasting tradition is a secret language. Without symbols to give energy form, the most a spellcaster can manage are cantrips.
>
> The languages themselves are poorly understood artifacts from an age where gods walked the land. They are natural forces, akin to gravity or heat, that operate on a set of orderly principles. Nearly all of them have an innate magical property that requires no spellcasting skill to use, and it is this property that allows spellcasting to take place. A spell is simply energy that has been funneled into a language in a very specific way, allowing it to manifest in predictable effect.

#### Cults and Languages

> As their name suggests, most secret languages are closely guarded by a mystery cult. Many are all but impossible to learn without undergoing the rites of initiation. This is partly due to the lack of instructors, but also because of the physical changes that a rite involves. Scholars theorize that the knowledge of a secret language can be passed along through bloodlines as well, citing the frequency with which [humans](../../character_creation/race/human#standard) are born with instinctual knowledge of one.

#### Draconic: The Synthetic Language

> Some scholars have suggested that the languages themselves might be primordial spells that the gods cast. The implications are heretical to most, and impossible to prove regardless, but such a theory would go some way towards explaining Draconic.
>
> The apocryphal founder of the [Elven Empire](../../lore/greenlands/elves) supposedly created the Draconic language nearly ten thousand years ago. It became the cornerstone of wizardry, a tradition distinct from the so-called divine magicks of the mystery cults. With it, the Elven people were able to subjugate neighboring human and Halfling tribes.
>
> Knowledge of this practice would not remain secret for long. Soon there were human servants studying arcane magic, then halfling traders, then dwarven spies. The relative openness of wizardry caused a veritable explosion of knowledge and led to the development of many different spells, a tradition which continues to this day.

#### Scrolls

> A scroll is a spell that has been cast and bound into paper (or a similar medium). Wizards are the most adept at crafting scrolls; Draconic is a language that lends itself to scribing, with other secret languages requiring more involved rituals to accomplish the same. Once formed, a scroll acts as a portable reservoir of predetermined energy. Any spellcaster with knowledge of the spell in question can "unlock" the energies within, loosing the spell.
> 
> Scroll scribing is one of the few traditions that Kindred and City Dwellers both practice. Notably, scrolls are also one of the few items the City Dwellers are willing to trade for.
