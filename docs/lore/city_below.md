# The City Below

#### Discovery

> The City was discovered within the decade by a [Piper](../character_creation/background/piper) that had lost her way while traveling the Nameless Desert. The crumbling sandstone buildings suggest the outline of a once-great city, though no historical records can be found mentioning its existence. The [Elves](../character_creation/race/elf) are especially unsettled by this, given their extensive record keeping over numerous generations.

#### The City Above

> There is little to be seen of the City surface-side. No carvings, no burial grounds or temples, nothing at all to suggest what sort of place it may once have been. The remnants are piecemeal and shattered. A few sects of scholars have suggested that the City Above may have been destroyed by some great disaster.

#### The City Below

> All that is of interest to the adventuring world exists beneath ground. Crude tunnels can be found in the basements and collapsed courtyards of the City Above. They wind in a maddening labyrinth that defies modern cartography.
> 
> While some have suggested that magic is to blame, others feel that it is simply untenable to sketch out a three-dimensional chart of sufficient complexity. Some tunnels cross one another. Some go over, under, and around known routes. Collapses are frequent and many a party has found themselves exiting miles from where they entered.
