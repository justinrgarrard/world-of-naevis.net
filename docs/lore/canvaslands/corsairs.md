# Corsairs

#### Bounty Hunters and Bodyguards

> The Corsairs are mercenaries that function as a law enforcement presence throughout the Canvaslands. Merchants hire them to catch thieves, defend their stalls, or sabotage their competitors. 

#### Thieves' Guild

> Despite their role, Corsairs are little better than bandits themselves. They behave as a grouping of gangs who demand "protection money" for their services. Skirmishes between gangs over disputes and lucrative clients are not unheard of.
