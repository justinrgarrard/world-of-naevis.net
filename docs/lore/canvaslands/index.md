# Canvaslands

#### A Melting Pot

> By virtue of being far outside any national borders, the Canvaslands has become home to all manner of individuals. Racial and socioeconomic boundaries are more permeable here than anywhere else in Naevis. It is perhaps the only place a human and an elf might speak on equal terms.

#### Outcasts and Exiles

> Adventurers are not the only inhabitants. Many individuals who are [no longer welcome](../../character_creation/background/exile) in their homelands have found their way to the Canvaslands. Heretical mages, runaway princes, and former bandit kings blend in with the local population, perhaps plotting their revenge.

#### Ambassadors

> The flip side of the former group, a number of [diplomats](../../character_creation/background/emissary) have come to see the region as a demilitarized zone ideal for negotiating treaties and trade contracts. The uncomfortable climate keeps it from being a popular location, but a lack of excessive scrutiny makes it perfect for drafting secret alliances.
