# Orcfolk

#### Overview

> A loose category that encompasses orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. Orcfolk belong to militant and integrated societies. They are one of the few City factions that demonstrate a firm grasp of tactics and engineering. 

#### Settlements

> Orcish villages are tightly guarded and possess stone walls. Organized patrols walk the village borders on watch for intruders or hostile fauna. Though lacking a larger national identity, orcish tribes do keep in contact with one another, trading for resources and occasionally skirmishing over valuable hunting lands.

#### Disposition

> Orcfolk, like most City dwellers, are hostile to unfamiliar races. They are a dour and hardy people well-used to living difficult lives.
