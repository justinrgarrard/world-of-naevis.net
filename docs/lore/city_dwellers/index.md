# City Dwellers

**Language**

> Unlike the Kindred, City Dwellers share the same spoken [language](../../adventuring/languages) (Undercommon) and written language (Infernal) regardless of race. They are notably not proficient in Common. 

**Magic**

> City Dwellers do not use magic as Kindred do. They are neither wizards nor clerics, instead seeming to practice entirely distinct traditions of spellcraft. They are generally superior spellcasters, and all are capable of using spell scrolls.

**Technology**

> While inhabitants of the City tend to have stronger magic, their technological prowess is considerably weaker. Their weapons are made of stone and bone, and their clothing is made of monster hides.

**Architecture**

> Buildings are uncommon in the City Below. Underground living is largely bereft of weather and seasons, removing one of the main impetuses for lasting shelters. Instead, camps and decorated caves make up the most common living quarters. Most are charmed with exotic forms of warding to sound alarms or rebuke trespassers.

**Religion**

> Denizens of the City worship the [Nine Devil Princes](devil_princes), a pantheon of supposed demigods. These Princes have no known cult in the surface world. Where the gods of Kindred are held to exist outside of the physical world, the Devil Princes are rumored to walk among their followers in the flesh. 

**Economy**

> City Dwellers operate on a barter economy. Scrolls are the nearest approximation of currency, being both lightweight and useful for daily life. More valuable transactions may be conducted with [Elemental Crystals](../../more/loot_tables/elemental_crystals).
