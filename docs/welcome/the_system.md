# The System

#### Doing More With Less

Naevis uses the [*5E Basic Rules*](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). It has [four classes](../character_creation/class/index), [four races](../character_creation/race/index), and a [subset of spells](../more/spells/index). These restrictions have several purposes.

1. **To Keep the World More Grounded**, allowing for roleplay that focuses on the relationships between a small number of cultures instead of a [Fantasy Kitchen Sink](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink).
   
2. **To Reduce the Amount of Material** that players and game masters need to keep in the forefront of their minds during play.
   
3. **To Encourage Strategy**, forcing players to think carefully about the tradeoffs that each character creation decision brings.

#### Experienced Players

In practice, the system will have little impact on parties that are already familiar with 5E. The core mechanics of fighting, exploring, and socializing remain unchanged. Veteran players may need to briefly review [variant encumbrance](../adventuring/encumbrance) but should otherwise be unaffected.

Rather, the changes that do exist are largely intended to revitalize neglected mechanics like [tools](../../data/downtime_activities/alchemy), [languages](../adventuring/languages), and [downtime](../adventuring/downtime).
