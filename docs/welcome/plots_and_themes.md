# Plots and Themes

{: .note}
> **Narrative Arcs**
> 
> While sessions typically center on dungeon diving, narrative arcs are expected to gradually emerge as long-simmering conflicts in the world spill over on to the party's expeditions. Adventurers are liable to find themselves drawn in as mercenaries, partisans, or unwitting pawns.


> ##### National Tensions
>
> The two global powers of the era, the [Elven Empire](../lore/greenlands/elves) and the [Dwarven City-States](../lore/greenlands/dwarves), are eager for any advantage against one another. Any sufficiently powerful artifact might be enough to tip the scales.
>
> ##### The City Below
>
> The [civilizations](../lore/city_dwellers/index) beneath the City are wholly unconnected with the surface world. They have different languages, different gods, different magic, and different world views. How will the two worlds react as they come into contact with one another?
>
> ##### Technology
>
> Recent innovations have begun to encroach upon the realm of magecraft. What will happen if [charms](../gear/charms) and [potions](../gear/alchemics) are spread amongst the untrained masses?
>
> ##### Mystery Cults
>
> Religion in Naevis takes the form of countless [Mystery Cults](../lore/canvaslands/mystery_cults), small insular organizations that guard cosmic secrets. Some are benign to the wider world, most are indifferent, but a few are actively malicious, plotting terrible misdeeds to further their dark agendas.
