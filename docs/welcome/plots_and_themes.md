# Plots and Themes

The world of Naevis bears a resemblance to our own Age of Discovery, when sailing techniques had just reached a level such that cross-oceanic travel was feasible, and strange tidings of unimaginable wealth were coming from new lands. There are culture clashes, technological innovations, language barriers, ancient grudges, and eager profiteers looking to make a killing from it all.

While sessions typically center on dungeon diving, narrative arcs will gradually emerge as long-simmering conflicts reach a boiling point. Adventuring parties flush with powerful artifacts are liable to find themselves drawn into fights against their will.

> ***National Tensions***
>
> The two global powers of the era, the [Elven Empire](../lore/greenlands/elves) and the [Dwarven City-States](../lore/greenlands/dwarves), are eager for any advantage. The subservient [Human Kingdoms](../lore/greenlands/humans) wish fervently for any magic or artifact that might free them from the tyranny of their longer lived masters. And the [Halfling Nomads](../lore/greenlands/halflings) watch on with a careful eye, concerned about the devastation that an imbalance of power might bring.
>
> ***The City Below***
>
> The [civilizations](../lore/city_dwellers/index) beneath the City are wholly unconnected with the surface world. They have different languages, different gods, different magic, and different world views. Most surface dwellers are unconvinced that other sapient races even exist. How will the two worlds react as they come into contact with one another?
>
> ***Alchemics***
>
> The practice of [alchemy](../../data/downtime_activities/alchemy) has a long history, but recent innovations have begun to encroach upon the realm of sorcery. Many potions and explosives can mimic the power of a true mage. Tinkers and enchanters both have flocked to the Canvaslands for the chance to develop some further innovation in their ongoing rivalry.
>
> ***Mystery Cults***
>
> Religion in Naevis takes the form of countless [Mystery Cults](../lore/canvaslands/mystery_cults), small insular organizations that guard cosmic secrets. Some are benign to the wider world, most are indifferent, but a few are actively malicious, plotting large sacrifices or terrible misdeeds to further their unknowable agendas.
