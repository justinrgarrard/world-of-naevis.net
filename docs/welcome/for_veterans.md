# For Veterans

#### Dungeon Crawling for Great Good

The 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons came out in 2014. Since then dozens of supplement books have been released, each expanding the already considerable *Player's Handbook* with hundreds of new character customization options. 

These changes have allowed for all manner of exciting and interesting games. However, they have also created a degree of friction, as Game Masters find themselves fielding questions on which variations are legal at their table. Without special care, a Game Master can find their *Lord of the Rings* campaign evolving into a superhero comedy, complete with talking robots, bird people, and humanoid slimes. 

Naevis was created to work around that particular issue by standardizing on a specific genre: **Swords and Sorcery Adventures**. To that end, it employs restrictions on character options to create a smaller, more coherent world.

#### The Big Changes

##### Character Options

> * Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard are the only available class options. 
> * Human, Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling are the only available races. 
> * Spell lists have been reduced to those included in the Basic Rules.
> * Non-basic [archetypes](../more/archetypes/index) are disallowed, with new optional archetypes made available.
> * Multiclassing now requires a special [feat](../more/feats/index) for each class.

##### Inventory Management

> * [Variant Encumbrance](../adventuring/encumbrance) is in play.
> * [All items](../more/items/index) have prices that round to the nearest gp.
> * [Resting](../adventuring/resting) consumes rations.
> * *Uncommon* magic items are harder to find. 
> * Some items, such as Bags of Holding, do not exist in the setting.
> * The number of items that can be attuned is [determined by Charisma](../adventuring/attunement). 

##### Tools, Languages, and Downtime

> * [Downtime](../adventuring/downtime) has been overhauled.
> * Tools unlock new downtime options related to [alchemy](../../data/downtime_activities/alchemy).
> * The number of [languages](../adventuring/languages) has been reduced and their utility improved.
