# For Veterans

#### Signs That Naevis Might Be For You

> * Your players showed up to a *Lord of the Rings* style campaign with a Warforged, a Kenku, and a Tabaxi.
>
> * The new player stopped coming to games after their Human Fighter was hopelessly outclassed by the min-maxer's Hexadin.
>
> * Your party's last combat took two sessions to run.

#### Doing More With Less

> The 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons came out in 2014. Since then dozens of supplement books have been released, each expanding the already considerable *Player's Handbook* with hundreds of new customization options. 
> 
> While these changes have allowed for new styles of play, they have also introduced new challenges. Differences in character power levels, in mechanical complexity, and in sheer volume of information can hamper a table, as players and game masters alike struggle to gracefully incorporate the expanded ruleset into their campaigns.
> 
> **Where modern 5E focuses on breadth of options, Naevis focuses on depth**. 
>
> Naevis aims to provide a "Swords and Sorcery" experience rather than a "Fantasy Kitchen Sink". It deliberately limits itself to four classes, four races, and a few dozen spells (all from the [5E Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)).

#### The Big Changes

##### Character Options

> * Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard are the only available class options. 
> * Human, Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling are the only available races. 
> * [Spell Lists](../more/spells/index) have been reduced to those included in the Basic Rules.
> * Non-basic [archetypes](../more/archetypes/index) are disallowed, with new optional archetypes made available.
> * Multiclassing now requires a special [feat](../more/feats/index) for each class.

##### Inventory Management

> * [Variant Encumbrance](../adventuring/encumbrance) is in play.
> * [All items](../more/items/index) have prices that round to the nearest gp.
> * [Resting](../adventuring/resting) consumes rations.
> * *Uncommon* magic items are harder to find. 
> * Some items, such as Bags of Holding, do not exist in the setting.
> * The number of items that can be attuned is [determined by Charisma](../adventuring/attunement). 

##### Tools, Languages, and Downtime

> * [Downtime](../adventuring/downtime) has been overhauled.
> * Tools unlock new downtime options related to [alchemy](../../data/downtime_activities/alchemy).
> * The number of [languages](../adventuring/languages) has been reduced and their utility improved.
