# 5E Veteran's Corner

#### Signs That Naevis Might Be For You

> * Your party loves tactical gameplay, but is tired of combat encounters that take two sessions to run.
>
> * Half of your party are emulating *Lord of the Rings*, while the others are emulating *Final Fantasy*.
> 
> * There is a divide in your party between those who optimize characters and those who don't.

#### How Naevis Addresses Common Problems

##### A Simpler World

> Naevis uses a small number of familiar races and classes to facilitate roleplaying. It departs from the [Fantasy Kitchen Sink](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink) approach, focusing instead on creating a coherent world for players to explore.

##### Dungeon Crawling Aids

> Prepping and running a session is easier in Naevis. Rules for [creating dungeons](../gm_guide/dungeons/dungeons), [running short combats](../gm_guide/combat/combat), and [handling resting](../adventuring/resting) are introduced to keep the game moving at a good pace with modest effort.

##### Cognitive Load

> The reduced count of magic items, spells, and [archetypes](../more/archetypes/index) helps to keep the game world manageable. Players and game masters alike have an easier time when the world fits in a single book, rather than two dozen supplements.
