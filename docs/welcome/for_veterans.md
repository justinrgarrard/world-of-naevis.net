# 5E Veteran's Corner

#### Signs That Naevis Might Be For You

> * Your party loves tactical gameplay, but is tired of combat encounters that take two sessions to run.
>
> * Half of your party are emulating *Lord of the Rings*, while the other are emulating *Final Fantasy*.
> 
> * There is a divide in your party between those who use optimized builds and those who don't.

#### How Naevis Addresses All That

> Naevis is a compromise. In exchange for trading away some of the customization options in 5E, it provides a focused and streamlined experience. Players will have an easier time roleplaying in a shared narrative context, while game masters will find it easier to craft stories and tactical challenges.
> 
> Naevis also includes specialized rules for [creating dungeons](../gm_guide/rooms/rooms), [running short combats](../gm_guide/combat/combat), and [restricting resting](../adventuring/resting). These help to give sessions a tangible dungeon crawling flavor. They also create a shared set of assumptions between players and game masters about resources.
