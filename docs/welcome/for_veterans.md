# 5E Veteran's Corner

#### Signs That Naevis Might Be For You

> * Your party loves tactical gameplay, but is tired of combat encounters that take two sessions to run.
>
> * Half of your party are emulating *Lord of the Rings*, while the others are emulating *Final Fantasy*.
> 
> * There is a divide in your party between those who use optimized builds and those who don't.

#### How Naevis Addresses Common Problems

> * **Specialized Setting Rules** are introduced for [creating dungeons](../gm_guide/dungeons/dungeons#hazard), [running short combats](../gm_guide/combat/combat), and [restricting resting](../adventuring/resting), the better to keep crawls engaging and fast-paced.
> 
> * **Limitations on Customization** provide a space where build exploration is rewarded, but not to the extent of eclipsing [quickstart](../character_creation/index#quickstart) characters. Limitations also aid in creating a more cohesive world.
>
> * **Lower Level Gameplay** changes how tables approach problems, placing greater importance on player strategy over character powers.
