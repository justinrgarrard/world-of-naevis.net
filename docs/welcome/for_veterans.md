# For Veterans

#### Signs That Naevis Might Be For You

> * Your party's last combat encounter took two weeks to finish.
>
> * Your party showed up to a *Lord of the Rings* themed campaign with a Warforged, a Kenku, and a Tabaxi.
>
> * Your party has a Sorcadin that's better at fighting than the Fighter, and better at wizardry than the Wizard.

#### Doing More With Less

> The 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons came out in 2014. Since then dozens of supplement books have been released, each expanding the already considerable *Player's Handbook* with hundreds of new customization options. 
> 
> While these changes have allowed for new styles of play, they have also introduced challenges. Differences in character power levels, added mechanical complexity, and sheer volume of information can hamper a table, as players and game masters alike struggle to gracefully incorporate the expanded ruleset into their campaigns.
> 
> Naevis takes a different approach. **Where modern 5E focuses on breadth of options, Naevis focuses on depth**.
