# Primer

#### The Premise

> Adventurers have come from far and wide to explore the newly discovered [Forgotten City](../lore/city_below), an underground ruin overflowing with exotic treasures and terrible dangers. They have settled in a desert outpost called the [Canvaslands](../lore/canvaslands/index) just outside the City's entrance. 

#### The Party

> You are an adventurer from the [Greenlands](../lore/greenlands/index), the fertile north where civilization thrives. You may be a sellsword, a criminal, a curious scholar, or have any number of reasons for seeking out the City. You live in one of the many hostels run by aspiring slumlords; uncomfortable yurts offering meager protection from the desert elements. Together with an outfit of similarly-minded fellows, you earn your daily bread in this desolate land by trading rare materials found in the City's bowels.
> 
> It is brutal, punishing work. But it also puts you on the forefront of a new age. Every artifact uncovered threatens to overturn centuries of existing research. Miraculous weapons promise to revolutionize warfare, while enigmatic panaceas go far beyond what modern alchemy can muster.
> 
> You, adventurer, have a chance to go down in history as the harbinger of an era. 

#### The System

> Naevis uses the [*5E Basic Rules*](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). It has [four classes](../character_creation/class/index), [four races](../character_creation/race/index), and a [subset of spells](../more/spells/index). These restrictions have several purposes.
> 
> 1. **To Keep the World More Grounded**, allowing for roleplay that focuses on the relationships between a small number of cultures.
>    
> 2. **To Reduce the Amount of Material** that players and game masters need to keep in the forefront of their minds during play.
>    
> 3. **To Encourage Strategy**, forcing players to think carefully about the tradeoffs that each character creation decision brings.
