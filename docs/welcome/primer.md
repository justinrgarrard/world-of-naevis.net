#### Places

> ##### The Nameless Desert
>
> A [vast arid desert](../lore/nameless_desert) prone to sandstorms and drought. Giant scorpions and sand worms hunt for unsuspecting wanderers foolish enough to venture in without a guide.
>
> ##### The City Below
>
> A subterranean otherworld beneath the long-destroyed ruins of a mysterious desert city. The great powers of Naevis covet the treasures hidden within.
>
> ##### The Canvaslands
>
> A [lawless shantytown](../lore/canvaslands/index) of yurts and market stalls that sprung up around the City's entrance. Within its unmarked boundaries are tradesmen, soldiers, camp followers, and aspiring adventurers. 


#### People

> ##### Adventurers
> 
> The greedy, the desperate, and the hopeful. [Persons of talent](../character_creation/index) that have left the comforts of civilization to plumb the City's depths for fortune. 
>
> ##### Embassies
>
> Ambassadors of the [Elves](../lore/greenlands/elves) and [Dwarves](../lore/greenlands/dwarves). Their thousand-year war against one another is continued in the Canvaslands, albeit with less bloodshed and more espionage. Representatives from both nations are on the watch for powerful artifacts that can upset the current balance of power.
>
> ##### City Dwellers
>
> Strange, monstrous [creatures](../lore/city_dwellers/index) that speak in tongues and wield powerful magic. Native to the City's underground tunnels, where civilizations entire thrive far from the sun.

> The written language of the City Below, used in mystic tomes, scrawled warnings, and other writing found beneath the crust of the earth.
>
> ##### Words of Power

<!-- > Naevis uses the [*5E Basic Rules*](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). It has [four classes](../character_creation/class/index), [four races](../character_creation/race/index), and a [subset of spells](../more/spells/index). These restrictions have several purposes.
> 
> 1. **To Keep the World More Grounded**, allowing for roleplay that focuses on the relationships between a small number of cultures.
>    
> 2. **To Reduce the Amount of Material** that players and game masters need to keep in the forefront of their minds during play.
>    
> 3. **To Encourage Strategy**, forcing players to think carefully about the tradeoffs that each character creation decision brings. -->
