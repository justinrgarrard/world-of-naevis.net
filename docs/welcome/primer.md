#### Places

> ##### The City Below

> A [subterranean otherworld](../lore/city_below) beneath the ruins of a mysterious desert city. The great powers of Naevis covet the treasures hidden within.
>
> ##### The Canvaslands
>
> A [lawless shantytown](../lore/canvaslands/index) of yurts and market stalls that sprung up around the City's entrance. Within its unmarked boundaries are tradesmen, soldiers, camp followers, and aspiring adventurers. 
> 
> ##### The Nameless Desert
>
> A [vast arid desert](../lore/nameless_desert) prone to sandstorms and drought. Giant scorpions and sand worms hunt for unsuspecting travelers foolish enough to venture in without a guide.


#### People

> ##### Adventurers
> 
> The greedy, the desperate, and the hopeful. [Persons of talent](../character_creation/index) that have left the comforts of civilization to plumb the City's depths for fortune. 
>
> ##### Embassies
>
> Ambassadors of the [Elves](../lore/greenlands/elves) and [Dwarves](../lore/greenlands/dwarves). Their thousand-year war against one another is continued in the Canvaslands through espionage and subtle power plays. Representatives from both nations stand watch for powerful artifacts that could upset the current balance of power.
