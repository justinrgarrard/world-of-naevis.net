# Primer

{: .note}
> ##### System
>
> * **[5E Basic Rules](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)**
> * **Four Classes**: Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard.
> * **Four Races**: Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Human.

#### You

> ... are an adventurer, an individual of unusual skill and remarkable drive, come to the Canvaslands for [your own ends](../character_creation/background/index). 
>
> You may be a swordsman, a scoundrel, or a practitioner of some esoteric art. But first and foremost, you are a survivalist. You face hunger and thirst as readily as any monster. Your wits, rather than skill at arms, are your greatest asset.
>
> As you venture into danger, keep these three guidelines in mind:
>
> * Not all fights can be won.
> * Not all mysteries can be solved.
> * Careful preparation is worth more than spell or steel.

#### Places

> ##### The City Below
>
> A [subterranean otherworld](../more/the_city_below/index) beneath the ruins of a mysterious desert city. Its tunnels are filled with treasures and danger.
>
> ##### The Canvaslands
>
> A [lawless shantytown](../more/the_world/canvaslands) of yurts and market stalls around the City's entrance. Aspiring slumlords rent out hostels to adventuring parties in the area, while opportunistic merchants trade water for gold.
> 
> ##### The Nameless Desert
>
> A [vast arid desert](../more/the_world/nameless_desert) prone to sandstorms and drought. Giant scorpions and other megafauna hunt for any travelers foolish enough to venture in without a guide.


#### People

> ##### Adventurers
> 
> The greedy, the desperate, and the hopeful. [Persons of talent](../character_creation/index) that have left the comforts of civilization to plumb the City's depths. 
>
> ##### Embassies
>
> Ambassadors of the Elves and Dwarves. Their thousand-year war against one another is continued in the Canvaslands through espionage and subtle power plays. 
>
> ##### City Dwellers
>
> Strange, monstrous [creatures](../more/the_city_below/index) that speak in tongues and wield powerful magic. Native to the City's underground tunnels.
