# The Party

#### Age of Discovery

You are an adventurer from the [Greenlands](../lore/greenlands/index), the fertile north where civilization thrives. You may be a sellsword, a criminal, a curious scholar, or have [any number of reasons](../character_creation/background/index) for seeking out the City. You live in one of the many hostels run by aspiring slumlords; uncomfortable yurts offering meager protection from the desert elements. Together with an outfit of similarly misfit daredevils, you earn your daily bread in this desolate land by trading rare materials found in the City's bowels.

It is brutal, punishing work. But it also puts you on the forefront of a new age. Every [artifact](../more/loot_tables/index) uncovered threatens to overturn centuries of existing research. [Weapons](../more/loot_tables/sentient_weapons) of unimaginable power promise to revolutionize warfare, while enigmatic [panaceas](../more/loot_tables/panacea) go far beyond what modern alchemy can muster.

You, adventurer, have a chance to go down in history as the harbinger of an era.

> **Roles and Responsibilities**

> Those who survive the long trek into the [Nameless Desert](../lore/nameless_desert) are individuals marked by their training. [Fighters](../character_creation/class/fighter), [Priests](../character_creation/class/cleric), [Rogues](../character_creation/class/rogue), and [Mages](../character_creation/class/wizard) each bring key competencies to the table. A wise party will look to fill as many roles as possible.
