# Gameplay

#### The Big Idea

Naevis is a game about **dungeon crawling**. It is sometimes also about other things, like scheming wizards and evil cultists, but the focus is always on exploration. That means that players have two main goals in any given session:

1. Survive.
2. Collect treasure.

##### The Typical Dungeon

> An average session consists of the party exploring a map made of index cards. Each [Room](../gm_guide/rooms/rooms) may contain some manner of threat, treasure, hazard, or oddity. As the party explores, more of the map is revealed, with most single-session dungeons containing roughly [twelve rooms](../gm_guide/rooms/twelve_room_dungeon).

##### Threats 

> Some rooms have an obvious hostile force in them. Parties will generally have one chance to try diffusing the situation before swords are drawn. Man-eating ants might be receptive to [rations](../../data/items/rations). Orcs can be negotiated with in [Undercommon](../adventuring/languages). Even undead hordes can be bypassed with a sufficiently creative approach.
>
> But should cooler heads fail to prevail, combat will ensue. By design, [combat will rarely last for three rounds](../gm_guide/combat/combat). 

##### Hazards

> Other Rooms will present challenges that can't be resolved through combat. Boiling hot springs, toxic mushroom spores, and jagged cliffs can also impede progress and require careful planning to safely cross. Tools like rope and crowbars can prove the deciding factor in whether or not a party passes through without harm.

##### Oddities

> Not all Rooms include a barrier to progress. Many are simply strange, or have wholly optional elements, such as a tree with glowing fruits. Ambitious parties might engage with these features in the hopes of securing bonus treasure, while cautious or exhausted parties could choose to skirt around the edges.

#### The Little Ideas

##### Short Rests

> A dungeon is no place for leisurely napping. Long rests are prohibited while exploring. [Short rests](../adventuring/resting) can be taken using rations. Spellcasters are advised to stock up on [scrolls](../gear/scrolls).

##### Loot and Encumbrance

{: .mundane-item}
> **Loot (25 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 5 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.

> Given that loot is valued by weight, the [Variant Encumbrance](../adventuring/encumbrance) rules encourage strong characters that can carry their own gear and treasures. *Bags of Holding* and similar items do not exist in this setting.

##### Languages

> The Common tongue is not so common beneath the earth's surface. Adventurers hoping to try [diplomacy with monsters](../adventuring/languages#city-dweller-languages), make [peace with beasts](../adventuring/languages#sylvan), or [talk to ghosts](../adventuring/languages#abyssal) will need the right language proficiencies to do so. This also means that the character with the highest Charisma score is not necessarily the one who will be handling negotiations.

##### Downtime
> Brewing potions, fletching explosive arrows, and reading omens are all common [Downtime Activities](../adventuring/downtime) that adventurers engage in between sessions. Each provides benefits that may mean the difference between life and death on the next run.
>
> But in exchange for the freedom to purse those activities, adventurers are expected to spend **25 gp** to secure room and board. Those that don't are prohibited from undertaking any Downtime Activities.

##### Economy

> A select few adventurers take their winnings and leave for home, purses full and pride satisfied. But far more are addicted to the chase. They invest their earnings in [gear](../gear/index), [scrolls](../gear/scrolls), and [charms](../gear/charms), hoping for an even bigger payout on tomorrow's expedition to justify the expense.
