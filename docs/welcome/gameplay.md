# Gameplay

#### The Big Idea

{: .note}
> **Dungeon Crawl:** A tactical, resource-based survival game. Characters are typically between levels 1-10 and rely on their wits, rather than raw power, to succeed.

##### The Typical Dungeon

> An average session consists of the party exploring a map made of index cards. Each [Room](../gm_guide/toolbox/dungeons/index) may contain some manner of threat, treasure, hazard, or oddity. As the party explores, more of the map is revealed, with most single-session dungeons containing roughly twelve rooms.

#### The Little Ideas

##### Three Round Combats

> By design, combat will rarely last longer than [three rounds](../gm_guide/toolbox/combat/index). Diplomacy, bribery, and ambushes are encouraged.

##### Short Rests

> Long rests are prohibited during sessions. [Short rests](../adventuring/mechanics/resting) can be taken by consuming rations. Spellcasters are advised to stock up on scrolls.

##### Loot and Encumbrance

> [Loot](../adventuring/mechanics/encumbrance#loot) is valued by weight, with every **5 lbs. of treasure matching 25 gp**. The [Variant Encumbrance](../adventuring/mechanics/encumbrance) rules put a premium on Strength and storage space.


##### More

> Other mechanics, like [Languages](../adventuring/mechanics/languages), [Downtime](../adventuring/downtime), [Attunement](../adventuring/mechanics/attunement), and [Multiclassing](../more/feats/index) are discussed in their own sections.
