# Gameplay

#### The Big Idea

{: .note}
> **Dungeon Crawl:** A tactical, resource-based survival game. Characters are typically between levels 1-10 and rely on their wits, rather than raw power, to succeed.

##### The Typical Dungeon

> An average session consists of the party exploring a map made of index cards. Each [Room](../gm_guide/rooms/rooms) may contain some manner of threat, treasure, hazard, or oddity. As the party explores, more of the map is revealed, with most single-session dungeons containing roughly [twelve rooms](../gm_guide/rooms/twelve_room_dungeon).

#### The Little Ideas

##### Three Round Combats

> By design, combat will rarely last longer than [three rounds](../gm_guide/combat/combat). Diplomacy, bribery, and ambushes are encouraged.

##### Short Rests

> Long rests are prohibited during sessions. [Short rests](../adventuring/resting) can be taken by consuming rations. Spellcasters are advised to stock up on [scrolls](../gear/scrolls).

##### Loot and Encumbrance

> [Loot](../adventuring/loot) is valued by weight, with every **5 lbs. of treasure matching 25 gp**. The [Variant Encumbrance](../adventuring/encumbrance) rules put a premium on Strength and storage space.


##### More

> Other mechanics, like [Languages](../adventuring/languages), [Downtime](../adventuring/downtime), [Attunement](../adventuring/attunement), and [Multiclassing](../more/feats/index) are discussed in their own sections.


<!-- ##### Threats 

> Some rooms have an obvious hostile force in them. Parties will generally have one chance to try diffusing the situation before swords are drawn. Diplomacy, bribery, and roundabout tactics are encouraged. But should cooler heads fail to prevail, a fight will break out. By design, [combat will rarely last for three rounds](../gm_guide/combat/combat). 

##### Hazards

> Other Rooms will present challenges that can't be resolved through combat. Boiling hot springs, toxic mushroom spores, and jagged cliffs can also impede progress and require careful planning to safely cross. Many are hiding valuable treasures behind greater danger.

##### Oddities

> Not all Rooms include a barrier to progress. Some are simply strange, or have wholly optional elements. Rooms with riddles, mysterious shrines, exotic plants, and other static features fall under this category. -->

<!-- ##### Languages

> Adventurers hoping to try [diplomacy with monsters](../adventuring/languages#city-dweller-languages), make [peace with beasts](../adventuring/languages#sylvan), or [talk to ghosts](../adventuring/languages#abyssal) will need the right language proficiencies to do so. This means that the character with the highest Charisma score is not necessarily the one who will be handling negotiations. -->
