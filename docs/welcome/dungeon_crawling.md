# Dungeon Crawling

#### A House of Cards

A typical session consists of the party exploring a map made of index cards. Each [Room](../gm_guide/rooms/rooms) may contain some manner of threat, treasure, hazard, or oddity. As the party explores, more of the map is revealed, with most single-session dungeons containing roughly [twelve rooms](../gm_guide/rooms/twelve_room_dungeon).

#### Survival

##### Combat

> A rule of thumb is that combats do not typically go [longer than three rounds](../gm_guide/combat/combat). By design, most skirmishes that reach Round 3 have seen at least one side decimated and fleeing for survival.

##### Resting

> A dungeon is no place for leisurely napping. Long rests are prohibited while exploring. [Short rests](../adventuring/resting) can be taken using rations.

##### Loot and Encumbrance

{: .mundane-item}
> **Loot (25 gp)**
>
> *Treasure, 5 lb.*
>
> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.

> Given that loot is valued by weight, the [Variant Encumbrance](../adventuring/encumbrance) rules encourage strong characters that can carry their own gear and treasures. *Bags of Holding* and similar items do not exist in this setting.

#### Resolving Challenges

##### Threats 
> Threats are Rooms with an obvious hostile force in them. Though they can be resolved through combat, it is generally a good idea to explore [less lethal](../gm_guide/combat/combat) approaches. Take a Room full of man-eating Giant Ants as an example.
>
> * **Feed the Ants** a number of [rations](../../data/items/rations) to pacify them.
>
> * **Direct the Ants to Easier Prey** using the [Sylvan](../adventuring/languages#sylvan) language and Animal Handling, Persuasion, or Deception skills.
> 
> * **Intimidate the Ants** by convincing them you're more trouble than a full belly is worth.
> 
> * **Ambush the Ants** by throwing a [Firebomb](../gear/alchemics) into the room and regrouping behind the party Fighter.

##### Hazards

> Aside from threats, quite a few Rooms present challenges that can't be resolved through combat. Boiling hot springs, toxic mushroom spores, and jagged cliffs can also pose a challenge.

##### Oddities

> Not all Rooms include a barrier to progress. Many are simply strange, or have wholly optional elements, such as a tree with glowing fruits. Ambitious parties might engage with these features in the hopes of securing bonus treasure, while cautious or exhausted parties could choose to skirt around the edges.
 
#### Downtime

##### Outfitting

> A select few adventurers take their winnings and leave for home, purses full and pride satisfied. But most adventurers are addicted to the risk. They invest their earnings in [gear](../gear/index), [scrolls](../gear/scrolls), and [charms](../gear/charms), hoping for an even bigger payout than the last.

##### Preparing

> Brewing potions, fletching explosive arrows, and reading omens are all common [Downtime Activities](../adventuring/downtime) that adventurers engage in between sessions. Each provides benefits that may mean the difference between life and death on the next run.

##### Lifestyle Expenses

> Adventurers are expected to spend **25 gp** to secure room and board between sessions. Those that don't are prohibited from undertaking any Downtime Activities.
