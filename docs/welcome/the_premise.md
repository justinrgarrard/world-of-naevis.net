# The Premise

#### Call to Adventure

Adventurers have come from far and wide to explore the newly discovered [**Forgotten City**](../lore/city_below), an underground ruin overflowing with exotic treasures and terrible dangers. They have settled in a desert outpost called the [**Canvaslands**](../lore/canvaslands/index) just outside the City's entrance. Expeditions are mounted every few weeks with the explicit goal of acquiring as much treasure as one's [pack can hold](../adventuring/encumbrance).

> **Loot (25 gp)**

> *Treasure, 5 lb.*

> Carefully preserved monster viscera, rocks that glow when exposed to moonlight, damaged armor made of quality materials; this is anything that might be of interest to a curious merchant.

#### Complications

The City is a dangerous place. It's home to [strange creatures](../lore/city_dwellers/index) and [dark gods](../lore/city_dwellers/devil_princes). There are lethal traps, underground civilizations, and eldritch forces quietly stirring beneath the world's crust.

The Canvaslands are no safe haven either. Politics and banditry can pose a challenge to parties believing themselves safe from subterranean threats. Sandstorms, megafauna, and the simple harshness of the sun can be just as lethal.
