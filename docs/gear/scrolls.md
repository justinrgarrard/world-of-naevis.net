# Scrolls

[Mages](../character_creation/class/wizard) (and to a lesser extent [Priests](../character_creation/class/cleric)) are prized as scroll-users. Even the meekest of spellcasters can become portable artillery when girded with half a dozen *Thunderwave* scrolls. A first-level scroll can be **purchased for 25 gp** or sold for half that amount.

{: .language}
> Adventurers proficient in **Elven** can purchase scrolls at the discounted price of **20 gp**.
