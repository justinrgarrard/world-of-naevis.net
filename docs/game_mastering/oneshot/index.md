# Introductory Oneshot

#### An Introduction to Naevis

The first session in this setting should be designed as a standalone oneshot that can be completed within three hours. The goal of this session is to familiarize players with the setting and its basic mechanics.

Your objective, as the Game Master, is to **prioritize momentum.** Keep the game moving at a good pace, gently moving the players forward when they're stuck. 

#### Setting Player Expectations

Before rolling any dice, creating any characters, or doing anything else, you must sit down with your players and describe the type of game this supplement is designed to run.

> **Dungeon Crawl: A tactical, resource-based survival game. Gold, healing, and magic are in limited supply.**

It's important that everyone is on board with the type of game being run. If players are expecting a high-octane pulp action game, or a hack-and-slash adventure, frustration may result.

#### Setting GM Expectations

Equally important, you (the GM), need to have an understanding of the games that _Naevis_ is intended to run. The setting borrows heavily from [OSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance#Style_of_play) principles. A few of the most important are listed below:

**Player Skill > Character Builds**

> Sessions are not a test of how well-optimized a character is. They are about creative problem solving that leverages a character's abilities. Especially early on, keep games at low levels to facilitate a mindset of thinking through problems rather than overpowering them.

**Tactics**

> Fair fights get adventurers killed. Set the expectation (gently at first) that going toe-to-toe with monsters without a plan will end badly. Make monsters intelligent. Give them weaknesses. Place precarious cliffs nearby. Reward creative approaches.

**Death**

> In the words of [Arnold Kemp](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/), _"The world's cruelty must be instructed."_ Give your players adequate warnings, but do not spare them from consequences. A good way to think about this is the DM Moves system from [Dungeon World](https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/gamemastering/).
>
> *Soft Moves* are a warning. "The goblins nock their arrows and look ready to attack."
> 
> *Hard Moves* are a consequence. "Having failed to intimidate the goblins, they loose their arrows." 


**Yes, And...**

> The golden rule of improv. While you shouldn't be afraid to tell your players no when they try to do something impossible, you should try to work with their attempts. "You can't modify the _Disguise Self_ spell to mask your voice, but you might be able to make a Performance or Deception check to do it instead."
