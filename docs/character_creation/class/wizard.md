# Wizard

[Wizards](../../more/classes/wizard) are adventurers trained in the academic practice of arcane spellcasting. 

#### Well-Rounded Education
Arcane magic is taught alongside rhetoric, grammar, and mathematics in academies for the well-to-do. Though few ever develop to the point of casting full-fledged spells, most graduates are aware of what magic is capable of, and many can work simple cantrips.

In less "civilized" parts of the world, wizardry may be instructed through apprenticeship. This is prevalent among tribal shamans, village witches, and other rural traditions where schooling is uncommon.

<!-- #### Scrolls
A practitioner is valued as much for their ability to use [scrolls](../../gear/scrolls) as for their individual talents. Fortifications regularly stockpiles caches of scrolls to arm warmages, allowing them to wreak havoc at a level well-beyond their natural capacity.  -->

#### Arcane Magic
Navean wizards treat magic akin to technology. Users draw ambient energy from ley lines under the earth using a wand or similar implement, then shape the energy into spells. A wizard can handle energy more skillfully as they advance in level.

> A Navean wizard's selection of spells is typically determined by their [background](../background/index). A [Piper's](../background/piper) spellbook will lean towards charms and illusions, while a [Warlord's](../background/warlord) will focus on combat magic.
