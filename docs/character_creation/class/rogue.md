# Rogue

Rogues are the subtler counterpart to Fighters. Not quite as brawny, they make up for their lesser combat talents with a broader base of aptitudes. Their class description can be found [here](../../../data/classes/rogue).

#### Diverse Occupations
While rogues are commonly associated with thieves, the class represents a wide variety of different vocations. Archaeologists, sherpas, courtiers, and many others may fall under the category as "versatile specialists".

#### Roguecraft
Even a modest rogue can boast six different skills and two areas of [Expertise](../../../data/classes/rogue#expertise). They are universally proficient in the Cant sign language as well as a small [collection of hand tools](../../../data/items/thief_tools).

> **Expertise**
>
> A rogue with expertise in Arcana can outclass a wizard with their mystic knowledge, while a rogue with expertise in Athletics can outrun a trained warrior. Consider making the most of these benefits by pairing Expertise with a high ability score in the corresponding skill.
