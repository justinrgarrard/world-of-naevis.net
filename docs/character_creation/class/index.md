> **Non-Basic Classes**
> 
> Classes outside the four provided in the _[Basic Rules](../../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_ are not supported by this setting. Players interested in playing a Ranger, Paladin, or other class should consider making use of [multiclassing feats](../../more/feats/index) and playing a [variant human](../race/human#variant).

{: .note }
> **Archetypes**
>
> Archetypes are restricted to the four [options](../../more/archetypes/index) available from the _Basic Rules_ by default. A small number of setting-specific and external archetypes may be used instead with Game Master approval.
