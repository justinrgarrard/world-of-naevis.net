# Cleric

Clerics are initiates into one of Naevis' many mystery cults. As part of their induction, they undergo a ritual that kindles a font of magic within their bodies. Their class description can be found [here](../../../data/classes/cleric).

#### Mystery Cults

Religion in Naevis is organized across countless organizations, each with their own particular beliefs and rituals. While some venerate deities, many are non-theistic, focusing instead on a school of philosophy or way of life.

#### Divine Magic

Navean clerics wield their power by intuition rather than careful study. The energy that fuels their spells comes from within and grows steadily stronger as they advance in skill.

> **Domains**

> Most clerics are tied to the [Life Domain](../../../data/archetypes/cleric_life), drawing on qi, aura, or divine grace to fuel their abilities. However, more [exotic](../../more/archetypes/index) domains may be used with permission from the Game Master.
