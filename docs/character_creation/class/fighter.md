# Fighters

[Fighters](../../more/classes/fighter) are drawn from the ranks of sellswords and soldiers. Individuals that merit membership in this class are distinguished warriors known for their combat prowess.

#### Martial Arts

Skill at arms is the bare minimum requirement for one to be a fighter. Intelligent use of maneuvers, both [offensive](../../more/review/maneuvers_offense) and [defensive](../../more/review/maneuvers_defense), is crucial. Fighters also adopt or adapt a martial arts tradition, reflected in their [Fighting Style](../../more/classes/fighter#fighting-style) and other abilities.

#### Honor
One's reputation and history of service take on a force of their own, though it need not be positive. Heroes and black knights may find their names equally compelling for different reasons. **When you use your reputation as a warrior, you may make a Strength (Persuasion) or Strength (Intimidation) check.**

> Fighters begin play with the [Second Wind](../../more/classes/fighter#fighter-class) ability, which functions similarly to a rechargeable [potion of healing](../../gear/alchemics/potions). This makes them the sturdiest of the four base classes.
