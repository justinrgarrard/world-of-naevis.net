# Fighters

Fighters are drawn from the ranks of sellswords and soldiers. Individuals that merit membership in this class are distinguished warriors known for their combat prowess. Their class description can be found [here](../../../data/classes/fighter).

#### Martial Arts

Skill at arms is the bare minimum requirement for one to be a fighter. Intelligent use of maneuvers, both [offensive](../../more/review/maneuvers_offense) and [defensive](../../more/review/maneuvers_defense), is crucial. Fighters also adopt or adapt a martial arts tradition, reflected in their [Fighting Style](../../../data/classes/fighter#fighting-style) and other abilities.

#### Honor
One's reputation and history of service take on a force of their own, though it need not be positive. Heroes and black knights may find their names equally compelling for different reasons. **When you use your reputation as a warrior, you may make a Strength (Persuasion) or Strength (Intimidation) check.**

> Fighters begin play with the [Second Wind](../../../data/classes/fighter#fighter-class) ability, which functions similarly to a rechargeable [potion of healing](../../gear/alchemics). This makes them the sturdiest of the four base classes.
