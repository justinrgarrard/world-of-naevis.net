#### Descriptions

{: .mundane-item}
> **Candles (20)**
>
> For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Lantern, Bullseye**
>
> A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Luminessence**
> 
> This liquid is identical to a _flask of holy water_, but possesses additional properties. When shaken, it emits bright green light for 40 feet and dim light for 40 feet further for ten minutes. The water retains its potency and can be reactivated by shaking again. If applied to an object or creature, they remain lit for ten minutes and cannot become invisible. Any message written with the substance will be invisible to the naked eye, but glow when exposed to a _Light_ spell.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Oil (flask)**
>
> Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Tinderbox**
>
> This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

{: .mundane-item}
> **Torch**
>
> A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.
