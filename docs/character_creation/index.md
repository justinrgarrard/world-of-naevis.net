# Character Creation

#### Standard

New characters can be rolled up using the process detailed in the _[Basic Rules](../more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf)_, with minor differences in picking backgrounds and starting equipment. Traits (such as Ideals and Bonds) are optional.

1. Choose a [Class](class/index).
2. Choose a [Race](race/index).
3. Choose a [Background](background/index).
4. Determine [Ability Scores](ability_scores).
5. (Optional) Customize [Starting Equipment](../character_creation/equipment/index).


#### Quickstart 

<button type="button" name="character-generator-button" class="btn btn-blue">Generate Character &#127922;</button>

<div id="character-generated"></div>
