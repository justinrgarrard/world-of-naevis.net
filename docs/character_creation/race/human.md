# Human

Humans live as the vassals of Dwarves and Elves in small kingdoms between the two great powers. The kings of men are pawns of longer lived races, and their armies are little more than game pieces in a larger continental struggle for supremacy.

{: .language}
> **Common**, the human tongue, is widely used as the language of trade and diplomacy. All characters are proficient in Common.
>
> **Sylvan**, the language of beasts, is inherited through blood rather than instruction.
>
> **Abyssal**, the language of the dead, is also heritable, but far rarer and more stigmatized.

Hardy and adaptable, Standard Humans represent the largest bodies of common laborers in any land. Many have inherited the language of beasts, giving them a close kinship with hounds, livestock, and other farm animals. A small number inherit grave speech instead, gaining the ability to speak with ghosts and other undead.

Variant Humans are those who come from an unusual upbringing. Many hail from servile clans, lineages of humans raised to excel in a niche field, such as wizardry or warcraft. Others may be nobility or astounding prodigies.
