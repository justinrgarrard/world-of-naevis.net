# Human

Humans live in small kingdoms between the two great powers. The kings of men are pawns of Elves and Dwarves, their armies little more than game pieces in a larger continental struggle for supremacy.

>
> **Sylvan**, the language of beasts, is inherited through blood rather than instruction.
>
> **Abyssal**, the language of the dead, is also heritable, but far rarer and more stigmatized.
