# Elf

Navean elves belong to the [Elven Empire](../../the_frontier/greenlands/elves), the single most powerful nation state in the known world. Their ancient history is both a blessing and a curse. Elven society is rigidly stratified along bloodlines and codified traditions going back thousands of years.
