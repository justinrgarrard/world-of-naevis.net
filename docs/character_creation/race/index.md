# Race

#### The Four Kindred Peoples

* **[Elves](elf)** are the longest lived race, and the most influential. The Elven Empire is a dominant force in Naevis.
* **[Dwarves](dwarf)** contest Elven hegemony from their mountainous city-states. Their culture is militant and honor-based.
* **[Halflings](halfling)** are tribal nomads that live in caravans. They are skilled merchants, hunters, and warriors.
* **[Humans](human)** make up the lower classes of Elven and Dwarven nations. Their lot in life is typically one of servitude.

> **Optional Rule: Playing a City Dweller**
>
> A number of [intelligent races](../../lore/city_dwellers/index) have been discovered in the City Below. These creatures are capable of speech, magic, and trade. However, they are typically hostile to outsiders.
>
> Should the Game Master allow other races, players might roleplay their characters as being native to the City Below. The existing [backgrounds](../background/index) can be adapted appropriately; ambassadors from underground nations, clan exiles, and curious scholars might find their way up to the Canvaslands.
