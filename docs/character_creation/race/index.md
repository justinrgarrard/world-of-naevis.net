# Race

#### The Four Kindred Peoples

* **[Elves](elf)** are graceful and long-lived.
* **[Dwarves](dwarf)** are industrious and prideful.
* **[Halflings](halfling)** are nomadic and blessed with good fortune.
* **[Humans](human)** are versatile and numerous.

{: .note}
> **Optional Rule: Playing a City Dweller**
>
> A number of [intelligent races](../../lore/city_dwellers/index) have been discovered in the City Below. These creatures are capable of speech, magic, and trade. However, they are typically hostile to outsiders, and considered monstrous by Kindred.
>
> Should the Game Master allow other races, players might roleplay their characters as being native to the City Below. The existing [backgrounds](../background/index) can be adapted appropriately; ambassadors from underground nations, clan exiles, and curious scholars might find their way up to the Canvaslands.
