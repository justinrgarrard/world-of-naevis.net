# Halfling

Halflings have isolated themselves from the struggles of the other Kindred races. They live as nomads in winding caravans, carrying trade across all nations. They have no homeland to speak of, though many tribes maintain semi-permanent residences in the [Nameless Desert](../../the_frontier/nameless_desert).

{: .language}
> **Halfling** is the language of [alchemy](../../gear/alchemics/index). Nearly all recipes are written in the language and use the halfling measurement system. Proficient characters receive a 20% discount when buying alchemics, like potions.
