# Halfling

Halflings live as nomads in winding caravans, carrying trade across all nations. They have no homeland to speak of, though many tribes maintain semi-permanent residences in the [Nameless Desert](../../lore/nameless_desert).

{: .language}
> **Halfling** is the language of [alchemy](../../gear/alchemics). Nearly all recipes are written in the language and use the halfling measurement system. Proficient characters receive a 20% discount when buying alchemics, like potions.
