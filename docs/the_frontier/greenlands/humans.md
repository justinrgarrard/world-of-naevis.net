# Humans

#### Overview

The Human Kingdoms are puppet states ostensibly ruled by human monarchs. In truth, they are one and all vassals to either the Elven Empire or Dwarven City-States. The existence of kingdoms allows for a buffer zone between the heartlands of the two great powers.

#### Feudalism

The same power structures that long-lived races impose upon humans are carried forward; royalty rules over nobility, nobility rules over commoners. Farmers are levied as soldiers by kings skirmishing over land (usually at the behest of Elves or Dwarves). A few may distinguish themselves and be knighted. The rest live as they ever have, from harvest to harvest, never comprehending that they are game pieces in a war between great powers.

#### Powder Keg

Though elitists may think otherwise, humanity is a very dangerous force in the world. Humans represent the largest population of any Kindred race. They are highly adaptable, highly specialized, and often [innately talented](../../more/languages/secret_languages) in Words of Power. A Human revolt could lead to the destruction of the current world order if not handled properly. On this matter Elves and Dwarves agree. 

#### Age of Legends

The earliest Elven records speak of dangerous human factions that existed before their race was brought to heel. Human Wizard Kings who marshalled vast armies of the dead. Human tamers that bonded with wyverns and fought from the skies. Human knights whose oaths granted them power from the gods themselves. A thousand years were spent on their subjugation culminating in the erasure of all such records from human histories. Now only the most trusted of High Elven scholars are permitted to know how close the Empire once came to destruction at human hands.

Since that era, Elves have taken great care to ensure that humans are kept under a close watch. The most promising young talents are recruited into servant clans where they can be indoctrinated and put to use. 

#### Dwarven Dissent

Humans have a better quality of life in the Dwarven City-States than near anywhere else. Though citizenship is denied to them, human craftsman and soldiers are guaranteed rights proportionate to their station. Dwarven politicians with populist leanings have formed strong power bases with humans at their core. Humans even have (Dwarven) representatives called Tribunes who defend their legal statuses.

Even still, many humans are eager for more political power. Those that are not content with merely supporting agreeable Dwarven representatives pursue influence by other means. Human merchants and guilds are steadily becoming a force all of their own, a fact that makes many Dwarves nervous.
