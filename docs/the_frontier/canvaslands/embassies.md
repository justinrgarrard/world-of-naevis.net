# Embassies

#### The Elven Empire

The [Empire's](../greenlands/elves) interest in the City is principally to **maintain the status quo**. Civil officials watch closely for anything that might upset the balance of power in an unfavorable fashion. They will act to purchase, capture, and neutralize anything of significant power.

#### The Dwarven City-States

The [City-States'](../greenlands/dwarves) interest in the City is **overturning the status quo**. Any finding with the potential to destabilize the Empire is eagerly sought out and propagated. Even so, the Dwarves are mindful that such items have the potential to stir a slave rebellion within their own lands, a concern they share with the Empire.
