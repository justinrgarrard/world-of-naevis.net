# Literati

#### The Bleeding Edge

> A community of scholars has taken up residence in the Canvaslands. Despite the inhospitable conditions, many find the intellectual climate to be less stifling than that of their homeland, and enjoy the freedom to publish as their hearts dictate.

#### Heretics and Disgrace

> Correspondingly, most Literati are of ill-repute in civilized lands. There are a number whose crackpot theories have seen them disgraced from well-regarded circles. Others pursue taboo topics, like the closely kept secrets of the mystery cults or the development of dangerous alchemy. No small number are [human](../../character_creation/race/human) dissidents seeking to overturn the world order and free their people from servitude.

#### Anonymity

> Literati communicate near exclusively through postage. Members do not know one another's faces, races, or other characteristics. One is known solely by their ideas and their pseudonyms.

**Aspiring Necromancer**

> _One of the more common heresies, "fell necromancy" has been outlawed by both Elves and Dwarves for generations._
>
> * ***Ray of Frost***: Can use ray of frost.
> * ***Inflict Wounds***: Can cast inflict wounds twice per fight.
> * ***Fell Revival***: Animates a nearby corpse as one of the Restless Dead. Can be used twice per fight.

**Restless Dead**

> _A necromantic construct occupying a dead body. More golem than creature, it follows orders with a literal mind._
>
> * ***Already Dead***: Cannot be killed with non-magical weapons.
