> This section contains information on the game world and its inhabitants. Players are not required to be familiar with it before play.

#### The City Below

> The City Below, also called the **[Forgotten City](city_below)** or the **City Itself**, is a subterranean otherworld. It was discovered several years prior in the Nameless Desert. The great powers of Naevis covet its treasures.

#### The Canvaslands

> A [lawless shantytown](canvaslands/index) of yurts and market stalls that sprung up around the City's entrance. Within its unmarked boundaries are tradesmen, soldiers, camp followers, and aspiring adventurers. 


#### The Nameless Desert

> A [vast arid desert](nameless_desert) prone to sandstorms and drought. Megafauna like giant scorpions and sand worms hunt for unsuspecting wanderers foolish enough to venture in without a guide.

#### The Greenlands

> The settled, fertile lands on the northern half of the continent. The Elven Empire, the Dwarven City-States, and the Human Kingdoms are all located within this region. Food and drink in the Nameless Desert is imported from these lands at great expense.
