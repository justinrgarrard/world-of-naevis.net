# The City Below

#### Discovery

The City was discovered within the decade by a [Piper](../character_creation/background/piper) that had lost her way while traveling the Nameless Desert. The crumbling sandstone buildings suggest the outline of a once-great city, though no historical records can be found mentioning its existence. The [Elves](../character_creation/race/elf) are especially unsettled by this, given their extensive record keeping over numerous generations.

#### The City Above

There is little to be seen of the City surface-side. No carvings, no burial grounds or temples, nothing at all to suggest what sort of place it may once have been. The remnants are piecemeal and shattered. A few sects of scholars have suggested that the City Above may have been destroyed by some great disaster.

#### The City Below

All that is of interest to the adventuring world exists beneath ground. Crude tunnels can be found in the basements and collapsed courtyards of the City Above. They wind in a maddening labyrinth that defies modern cartography.

While some have suggested that magic is to blame, others feel that it is simply untenable to sketch out a three-dimensional chart of sufficient complexity. Some tunnels cross one another. Some go over, under, and around known routes. Collapses are frequent and many a party has found themselves exiting miles from where they entered.
