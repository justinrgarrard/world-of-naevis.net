# The Nameless Desert

#### Geography

Rolling sand dunes crest and fall for hundreds of miles in every direction. The burning sun bleaches the sand a perfect, blinding white. On rare cloud-filled days the desert is indistinguishable from the sky. Rumor has it that halfling villages can be found along secret oases.

#### Halflings

The nomadic [Halfling](../character_creation/race/halfling) tribes are not native to the Nameless Desert, but have spent several generations inhabiting it since their exodus from the greenlands. The desert provides a natural barrier against conquest by Elves or Dwarves, and time spent living among the wastes have made Halfling hunters exceptionally skilled. Deadly poisons are now one of their people's primary exports.

#### Djinn

The [Dreamweaver](../character_creation/class/cleric) mystery cult have stories of immortal air spirits who once dwelled within the Nameless Desert. In an age of myths, mortal mages once imprisoned the spirits in magical artifice. Flying carpets, magic rings, and other marvels were fueled by the Djinns' eternal attempts to escape their bindings. No such artifacts are known to exist in the modern era but many wistful adventurers hold out hope.
