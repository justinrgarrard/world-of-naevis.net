# Agua Regia

*Substance, common*

This acid is exceptionally strong, capable of dissolving gold and other metals.

**Attack.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

**Use an Object.** When applied to non-magical metals, up to one cubic foot of metal can be dissolved with a quiet hissing noise over the course of one minute. When applied to hardened [Alchemical Glue](alchemical_glue), the glue dissolves instantly.

If the user has proficiency in _Alchemist Supplies_, the acid's damage increases by their proficiency bonus.
