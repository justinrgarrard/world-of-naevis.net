# Alchemical Glue

*Substance, common*

This flask contains enough glue to cover a 1-foot square surface. The substance quickly hardens when exposed to air, forming a concrete-like material.

**Attack.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the glue as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target gains the Restrained condition. A creature can end this condition by using its action to make a DC 11 Strength check to break away. 

**Use an Object.** A door or container sealed with glue requires a DC 20 Strength check to open.

If the user has proficiency in _Alchemist Supplies_, the glue's DC increases by their proficiency bonus.
