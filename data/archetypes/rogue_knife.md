# Rogue: Knife Dancer

_Throwing knives are a popular choice for many adventurers, able to strike up close or at range, and discrete enough to fit in one's sleeve. Assassins, grenadiers, and street performers are common trades for this style of fighting._

#### Practiced Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to take the **Use an Object** action or make a ranged attack with an improvised throwing weapon (such as *Alchemist's Fire*). 

Additionally, you become exceedingly accurate with throwing weapons. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make when throwing a weapon in its normal range, and no longer suffer disadvantage for making long range attacks with such weapons.


#### Called Shot
At 3rd level, you learn to modify your Sneak Attacks, trading greater harm for debilitating effects. When you make a Sneak Attack you can forfeit one damage die to use one of the following:

* **Eyes**: The target creature gains the Blindness condition until the end of their next turn, or until they spend an action clearing their vision.

* **Throat**: The target creature is unable to speak or cast spells with a verbal component until the end of their next turn.

* **Knee**: The target creature has their movement set to zero until the end of their next turn.


#### Trick Shots
Starting at 9th level, you learn new techniques for throwing weapons.

* **Volley**: You can use your action to make a throwing weapon attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

* **Fan of Knives**: You can use your action to make a throwing weapon attack against any number of creatures in a 15 foot cone in front of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target. Attacks made against creatures in melee range do not suffer from disadvantage.


#### Reliable Marksmanship
Starting at 13th level, when you make an ranged weapon attack roll that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 5 or lower as a 6.


#### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.
