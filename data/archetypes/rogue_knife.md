# Rogue: Knife Dancer

_The practice of throwing knives is common to many martial and performance arts. Those who specialize in the discipline find their talents well-suited to the adventuring life. Assassins, grenadiers, and hunters have been known to follow this tradition._


#### Practiced Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to take the **Use an Object** action or make an improvised throwing weapon attack. The range of these attacks is 60 feet instead of 20 feet, and you are considered proficient in their use.


#### Throwing Expertise
At 3rd level, you become exceedingly accurate with throwing weapons. When you make a throwing weapon attack within 20 feet of the target, your proficiency bonus is doubled. Additionally, you no longer receive a penalty for making long range attacks with thrown weapons.


#### Extra Attack
Starting at 9th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. If you throw a weapon as part of these attacks, you can draw an additional weapon in the same motion.


#### Fan of Knives
Ay 13th level, you can use your action to make a ranged throwing attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.


#### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.
