# Fighter: Warprince

_The Windblade martial art is popular among Navean officers. Derived from traditional Elven techniques, users make use of momentum to wield their weapons with exceptional grace. Blademasters, sharpshooters, and professional duelists are typical practitioners._


#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in acrobatics. 


#### Sword Dance
Starting at 3rd level, any melee weapon without the _heavy_ property gains the _finesse_ property while you're using it.


#### Techniques
At 3rd level, you have mastered a set of advanced combat techniques. Using a bonus action, you can perform one of the following:

* **Kick**: You take the **Shove** action.

* **Pin**: You take the **Grapple** action.

* **Focus**: Until the end of your turn, you cannot have disadvantage when making a weapon attack.

* **Spin**: You activate two-weapon fighting as part of this technique, making an attack against a creature. You can use this technique even when the weapons you are using lack the _Light_ property.
