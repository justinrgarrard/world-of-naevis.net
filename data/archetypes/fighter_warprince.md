# Fighter: Warprince

_Warprinces are terrors on the battlefield, dancing between foes with lethal grace. Their approach to combat mixes rapid strikes with leg sweeps and joint locks to off-balance foes._

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in acrobatics. 


#### Wind Dancing
Starting at 3rd level, your unarmed attacks can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls. You roll a d4 in place of normal damage.

Additionally, any melee weapon without the _Heavy_ property gains the _Finesse_ property while you're using it.


#### Ferocious Action
At 3rd level, your extensive training allows you to take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used to take the **Shove**, **Grapple**, **Unarmed Strike**, and **Two-Weapon Fighting** actions.

When you use the **Two-Weapon Fighting** action in this way, you can do so even when using weapons that lack the _Light_ property.


#### Counter
Starting at 7th level, after an enemy makes a melee attack against you, you can expend your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against them. If the counterattack lands, it counts as a critical hit. Additionally, your proficiency bonus for acrobatics checks is doubled.


#### Blitz
At 10th level, you learn two new techniques for striking down hordes of foes.

* **Whirlwind Attack**: You can use your action to make a melee weapon attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

* **Wind Cutter**: You can use your action to make a melee weapon attack against any number of creatures in a 15 foot cone in front of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.


#### Glancing Blows
At 15th level, your melee attacks deal half damage (rounded down) on a miss. 


#### Dauntless
At 18th level, if you have no uses of Action Surge when rolling initiative, you regain one expended use.
