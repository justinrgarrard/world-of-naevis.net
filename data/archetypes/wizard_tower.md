# Wizard: Tower Mage

_Tower Mages are recluses that practice their arts away from civilization, developing a particular talent for scroll scribing. Many run their own ateliers supplying buyers with handmade scrolls._


#### Transmute Scroll

When you take this archetype at 2nd level, you gain the ability to improvise spell scrolls. As an action, you can expend your Arcane Recovery to magically duplicate one of the spells in your spellbook. The chosen spell must be of a level that you would otherwise recover using Arcane Recovery, and is stored within your spellbook on a blank page. The spell fades away when used or if left unused for 24 hours.

#### Scroll Arts

At 2nd level, when you cast a spell from a scroll, you can enhance it in one of the following ways:

* **Distant**: If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more, the range doubles. It the spell has a range of touch, it increases to 30 feet.
* **Extend**: If the spell has a duration of one round or longer, the duration of the spell doubles, to a maximum of 24 hours.
* **Empower**: If the spell deals damage, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to the scroll's level and take the new result.


#### Read Magic

At 6th level, you learn to use scrolls from outside your spell list. Spell scrolls from other spell lists are treated as Wizard spells for you. However, you cannot scribe a non-Wizard spell scroll into your spellbook.


#### Preserve Scroll

Beginning at 10th level, roll a d20 after casting a spell from a scroll. If the result is less than or equal to your Intelligence modifier, the scroll becomes inert rather than crumbling to dust, and regains its power after 24 hours.


#### Deep Reserves

At 14th level, you gain a second use of Arcane Recovery.
