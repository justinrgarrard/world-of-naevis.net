# Wizard: Tower Mage

_Tower Mages are wizards who devote themselves to understanding the fundamental mechanics of magic. They are able to cast cantrips more efficiently and more flexibly than other mages. Many fund their research by operating scroll scribing ateliers._


#### Subtle Cast

Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a cantrip, you can do so without any verbal or somatic components.


#### Quick Cast

At 2nd level, you can cast a cantrip that normally requires an action by using a bonus action. You must take a short or long rest before using this feature again.


#### Fundamentals

At 6th level, you learn two additional wizard cantrips.


#### Pocket Cast

At 10th level, you master a technique for casting spells that you haven't prepared. You can use an action and expend your Arcane Recovery activate this feature. When you do so, you cast a spell from your spellbook without expending a spell slot. The spell must be of a level that Arcane Recovery would otherwise be able to recover through its typical usage.


#### Deep Reserves

At 14th level, you gain a second use of Arcane Recovery.
