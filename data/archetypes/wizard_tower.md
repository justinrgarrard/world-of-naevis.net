# Wizard: Tower Mage

_Tower Mages are recluses that practice their arts in isolation. They may be magic craftsmen, arcane theorists, ward carvers, or others whose spellcasting requires exceptional technique and efficiency._


#### Weave Glamour

When you take this archetype at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast [Silent Image](../srd_spells/detect_magic) at-will. You do not need to prepare it or expend a spell slot when casting it.


#### Subtle Cantrip

Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a cantrip, you can do so without any verbal or somatic components.


#### Quick Cast

At 6th level, you can cast a cantrip or spell that normally requires an action by using a bonus action. You must take a short or long rest before using this feature again.


#### Pocket Cast

At 10th level, you master a technique for casting spells that you haven't prepared. You can use an action and expend your Arcane Recovery activate this feature. When you do so, you cast a spell from your spellbook without expending a spell slot. The spell must be of a level that Arcane Recovery would otherwise be able to recover through its typical usage.


#### Deep Reserves

At 14th level, you gain a second use of Arcane Recovery.
