# Wizard: Tower Mage

_Tower Mages are recluses that practice their arts in isolation. They may be mystic hermits, magic craftsmen, arcane researchers, or any other wizard whose studies emphasize the foundational principles of magic._


#### Weave Glamour

When you take this archetype at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast [Silent Image](../srd_spells/detect_magic) at-will. You do not need to prepare it or expend a spell slot when casting it.


#### Quick Cast

At 2nd level, you can cast a cantrip that normally requires an action by using a bonus action. You must take a short or long rest before using this feature again.


#### Break Curse

At 6th level, you add the [Remove Curse](../srd_spells/remove_curse) spell to your spellbook. It is treated as a Wizard spell for you. You can cast the spell without preparing it, but must take a short or long rest before doing so again.


#### Pocket Cast

At 10th level, you learn a technique for casting spells that you haven't prepared. You can use an action and expend your Arcane Recovery activate this feature. When you do so, you cast a spell from your spellbook without expending a spell slot. The spell must be of a level that Arcane Recovery is able to recover.


#### Deep Reserves

At 14th level, you gain a second use of Arcane Recovery.


<!-- #### Subtle Cantrip

Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a cantrip, you can do so without any verbal or somatic components. -->


<!-- #### Strong Fundamentals

At 2nd level, you learn two additional cantrips from the Wizard spell list.  -->
