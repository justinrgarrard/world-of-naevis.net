# Fighter: Lionheart

_Lionhearts are master knights possessed of incredible skill. Their approach to combat relies on punishing blows, breaking foes before they have a chance to act._

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in intimidation. 


#### Lethal Boundary
At 3rd level, creatures provoke an opportunity attack when they enter your reach. A creature struck by your opportunity attack has their movement set to zero until the start of their next turn.


#### Power Action
At 3rd level, your extensive training allows you to take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used after successfully damaging a creature with a melee weapon attack to add one of the following effects:

* **Cleave**: Make an additional weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of the target.

* **Repel**: Move the target 10 feet away from you in a straight line.

* **Addle**: Take away the target's reaction until the start of their next turn.


#### Impassable
At 7th level, the number of reactions you can take between turns increases to two. Your opportunity attacks have advantage. Additionally, your proficiency bonus is doubled when making intimidation checks.


#### Morale Control
Starting at 10th level, you learn two new techniques for influencing the flow of battle.

* **See Them Driven Before You**: Using an action, you bellow out a terrifying battle cry. Every hostile creature within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom save against your technique save DC or gain the Frightened condition for one minute.

* **Once More Into the Breach**: Using an action, you rally your allies with a deafening cheer. Every friendly creature within 60 feet of you is freed from the Frightened, Charmed, and Stunned conditions. 

**Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier


#### Glancing Blows
At 15th level, your melee attacks deal half damage (rounded down) on a miss. 


#### Dauntless
At 18th level, if you have no uses of Action Surge when rolling initiative, you regain one expended use.
