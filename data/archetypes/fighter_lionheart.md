# Fighter: Lionheart

_The Iron Spiral martial art is a favorite of knights and bodyguards. Descended from Dwarven tunnel fighting, its foundational principles center around control of the surrounding area._


#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in intimidation. 


#### Deathblow
At 3rd level, you learn to turn normal strikes into lethal blows. On a successful weapon attack, you can expend a use of this feature to convert an attack into a critical hit. You gain a use of this feature when you roll initiative or take the **Dodge** action while in combat. You lose any remaining uses when combat ends.


#### Lethal Boundary
At 3rd level, when you take the **Dodge** action, creatures provoke an opportunity attack when they enter your reach. A creature struck by your opportunity attack has their movement set to zero until the start of their next turn.


#### Impassable
At 7th level, the number of reactions you can take between turns increases to two. Additionally, your proficiency bonus is doubled when making intimidation checks.


#### Devastating Critical
Starting at 10th level, you can roll an additional damage die on a critical hit. Creatures struck by your critical hit must make a Constitution save or be Stunned until the end of their next turn. 

**Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)


#### Glancing Blow
At 15th level, your melee attacks deal half damage (rounded down) on a miss. The number of reactions you can take between turns increases to three.


#### Dauntless
At 18th level, if you have no uses of Action Surge when rolling initiative, you regain one expended use.
