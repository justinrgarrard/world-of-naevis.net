# Wizard: Djinn Mage

_Djinn Mages are wizards that draw inspiration from the mythical desert spirits of the same name. Their tradition is known for twisting spells in uncanny ways, making their Arts difficult to detect and counter._


#### Weave Glamour

When you take this archetype at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast [Silent Image](../srd_spells/silent_image) on yourself at-will. You do not need to prepare it or expend a spell slot when casting it.


#### Subtle Cast

At 2nd level, when you cast a spell from the Illusion or Enchantment schools, you can do so without verbal or somatic components.


#### Mirage Cast

At 6th level, you can cast a cantrip or spell that normally requires an action by using a bonus action. When you do so, you cast the spell without verbal or somatic components. You must take a short or long rest before using this feature again.


#### Pocket Cast

At 10th level, you master a technique for casting spells that you haven't prepared. You can use an action and expend your Arcane Recovery to activate this feature. When you do so, you cast a spell from your spellbook without expending a spell slot. The spell must be of a level that Arcane Recovery would otherwise be able to recover through its typical usage.


#### Deep Reserves

At 14th level, you gain a second use of Arcane Recovery.
