# Cleric: Demon Worshipper

_If a ghost is left uncleansed for years it will gradually fester into a demon, gaining flesh and terrible power. Exceptional demons may gather mortal servants around them, bestowing power upon favored minions through sinister rites._

#### Knight of Hell

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and learn the *Fire bolt* cantrip. You also learn the [Abyssal](../../docs/adventuring/languages#abyssal) language.

#### Reap

Beginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of 1).


#### Channel Divinity: Condemn

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity as a reaction when you are damaged by a creature within 60 feet. The creature takes 1d10 fire damage for each level of your proficiency bonus.


#### Channel Divinity: Lesser Wall of Flame

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a small wall of flame.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and the wall forms within five feet of you. It can be up to 10 feet wide, 5 feet high, and one foot thick. Any creature standing in the wall when it forms or attempting to move through the wall after it forms takes 1d8 fire damage per level of proficiency bonus you have. The wall exists for one minute before fading to non-magical embers.


#### Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.


#### Inner Strength

At 17th level, you gain an additional use of _Channel Divinity_.
