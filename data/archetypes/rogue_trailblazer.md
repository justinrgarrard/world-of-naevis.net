# Rogue: Trailblazer

_While most adventurers are survivalists, few invest the effort to become genuinely adept at navigating hostile climes. Trailblazers make for exceptional guides and can be found in the ranks of elite scouts and bounty hunters._

#### Practiced Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to take the **Use an Object** action or make a ranged attack with an improvised throwing weapon. Additionally, you count as proficient when making attacks with improvised weapons.


#### Experienced
At 3rd level, your prowess in exploring unfamiliar lands manifests in a number of ways.

* **Well-Traveled**: You learn two exotic languages of your choice.

* **Woodwise**: You gain proficiency in Survival and Nature, or other skills of your choice if you are already proficient.

* **Danger Sense**: You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. 


#### Called Shot
Starting at 9th level, you can forfeit the additional damage from a successful Sneak Attack to inflict either the Blinded or Restrained condition on a creature. The condition persists until the creature is treated using *Lesser Restoration* or a similar effect.


#### Inoculation
By 13th level, you have developed a resistance against most ailments. You are immune to disease and poison.


#### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.
