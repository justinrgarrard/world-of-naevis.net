# Cleric: Winter Witch

_Winter is an ancient and august order, one that predates Navean wizardry. Their magic has its roots in primal sorceries and elemental forces. Initiates tend to be ruthlessly pragmatic._


#### Winter Domain Spells

| Cleric Level |                        Spells |
| :----------- | ----------------------------: |

| 3rd          |        Darkness, Invisibility |

#### Frost Sorcery

* **Range**: The spell's range increases by 10 feet for each level of your proficiency bonus.

When you cast the _Sleep_ spell, you can use your Channel Divinity with a bonus action to roll the maximum possible result.
