# Cleric: Winter Witch

_Winter is an ancient order that draws their power from primal sorcery. Their initiation rites are rumored to involve moonlit sacrifices over bloodstained altars, with power drawn from the moment of death. Navean Wizardry is said to have been derived from these Old Ways and softened for use by those with faint hearts._
