# Rogue: Delver

_The archetypical adventurer, Delvers are rogues that are especially adept with magic items. Though not true spellcasters, they can emulate both arcane and divine magic through the use of scrolls._

#### Clever Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to drink a potion or take the **Use an Object** action. 


#### Savvy
At 3rd level, you learn to unlock the magic within scrolls through unorthodox means. You can use any spell scroll of a level equal to or less than your proficiency bonus. Your spellcasting modifier is Charisma. 


#### Uncanny Luck
Starting at 9th level, you have resistance to damage from traps, falling, and poison. 

Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.


#### Use Mystic Device
At 13th level, the number of items you can attune to increases by one.


#### Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised.
