# Read Omens

*Requires a level in Cleric or first-level divine spellcasting.* 

During the next session, you gain the ability to alter fate one time. You can reroll an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. Alternatively, you can force an attack roll against you to be rerolled. For any reroll, the new value is used.
