# Read Omens

*Requires a level in Cleric.* 

During the next session, you gain the ability to alter fate a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You can reroll an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. Alternatively, you can force an attack roll against you to be rerolled. For any reroll, the new value is used.

You can replace your cantrips with different options.
