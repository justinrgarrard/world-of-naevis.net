# Scribe Scrolls

*Requires a level in Wizard or first-level arcane spellcasting.*

You can perform one or both of the following tasks.

* Add a spell from a [scroll](../../docs/gear/scrolls) to your spellbook
* Create a first-level scroll from a spell in your spellbook

If you have a feature like [Evocation Savant](../../data/archetypes/wizard_evocation) you perform each task twice, provided that spells from the proper school are used. For example, Jon the Wizard can create two *Magic Missile* scrolls and learn two Evocation spells. However, he would not be able to utilize this benefit with a *Silent Image* scroll or Illusion spells.
