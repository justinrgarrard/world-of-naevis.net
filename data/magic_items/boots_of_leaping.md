# Boots of Leaping

*Boots, common, requires attunement*

A pair of leather boots that seem to float ever so slightly off the ground.

While wearing and attuned to these boots, you can use a bonus action to increase your jump range until the start of your next turn. Your long jump distance becomes 20 feet and your high jump distance becomes 10 feet.
