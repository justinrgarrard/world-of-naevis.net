# Marble Ring

*Ring, common, requires attunement*

This ring feels oddly heavy, but weighing it on a scale shows no discrepancies.

While attuned to and wearing this ring, you can cast the [*Mage Hand*](../srd_spells/mage_hand) cantrip. The weight of objects you can lift is multiplied by your Charisma modifier.
