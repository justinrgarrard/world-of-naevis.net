# Marble Ring of Force

*Ring, common, requires attunement*

This ring feels oddly heavy, but weighing it on a scale shows no discrepancies.

While attuned to this ring, you can cast the [*Mage Hand*](../srd_spells/mage_hand) cantrip. If you are a spellcaster, the weight of objects you can lift, the range of the cantrip, and the movement speed of the hand are multiplied by your proficiency bonus.
