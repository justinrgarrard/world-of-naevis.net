# Black Hammer

*Weapon (warhammer), common, requires attunement*

A perfectly black warhammer, seemingly hewn from a single stone.

Any strike made against an object using this hammer counts as an automatic critical hit. It can be used as a [portable ram](../../data/items/ram_portable) or [crowbar](../../data/items/crowbar). It counts as a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing damage resistance when attuned.
