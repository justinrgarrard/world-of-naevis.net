# Phantom Shortsword

*Weapon (Shortsword), common, requires attunement*

A short blade that feels as though it's filled with sloshing liquid.

When attuned and held, the wielder can extend an invisible blade past the sword's edge by swinging it. The shortsword has the _Reach_ property when used this way.
