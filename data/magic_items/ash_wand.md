# Ash Wand

*Spellcasting focus, common, requires attunement*

A black wand that radiates a soft warmth.

While attuned to this wand and holding it, you can cast the [*Fire Bolt*](../srd_spells/shocking_grasp) cantrip using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier. This item also functions as a [wand](../items/arcane_focus).

<!-- If you are a spellcaster, the range of the cantrip doubles. -->
