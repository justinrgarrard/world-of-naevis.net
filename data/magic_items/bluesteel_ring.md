# Bluesteel Ring

*Boots, common, requires attunement*

A ring made of a burnished blue metal.

While attuned and worn, you can cast the [*Guidance*](../srd_spells/light) cantrip on yourself a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You must complete a short or long rest before doing so again.
