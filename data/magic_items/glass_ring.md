# Glass Ring

*Glass Gem, common, requires attunement*

A ring seemingly made of woven glass.

While attuned and worn, you can cast the [*Light*](../srd_spells/light) cantrip, but only upon the ring itself. The ring can also serve as a [magnifying glass](../items/magnifying_glass). It is capable of supplying enough light to spark a fire or illuminate an object.
