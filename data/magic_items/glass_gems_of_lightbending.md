# Glass Gems of Lightbending

*Glass Gem, common, requires attunement*

A pair of gems that look to be made of quicksilver.

These gems come in pairs and can be used without attunement. When either gem is squeezed, the other briefly brightens, no matter the distance between the two. Users proficient in Cant can communicate in full sentences using this item. 

While attuned and held, you can cast the [*Light*](../srd_spells/light) cantrip using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier. 

<!-- If you are a spellcaster, you can change the shape of the *Light* spell to emulate a [bullseye lantern](../items/lantern_bullseye). -->
