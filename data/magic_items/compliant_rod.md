# Compliant Rod

*Weapon (Club), common, requires attunement*

A rod that can change shape, elongating and warping at the wielder's command.

While attuned and held, this rope can change its form to any of the following: a club, a quarterstaff, or a ten-foot pole. The rod weighs 1 lb. regardless of form. It counts as a magical weapon for the purposes of bypassing damage resistance when attuned.
