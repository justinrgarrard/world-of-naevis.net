# Volt Staff

*Weapon (Quarterstaff), spellcasting focus, common, requires attunement*

A metal quarterstaff that raises the hair on one's arm when held.

While attuned to this staff and holding it, you can cast the [*Shocking Grasp*](../../../srd_spells/shocking_grasp) cantrip using Charisma as your spellcasting modifier. If you are a spellcaster, the range of the cantrip increases to 10 feet.
