# Witchbone Ring

*Ring, common, requires attunement by a spellcaster*

An ivory ring that pulses with a heartbeat all its own.

While attuned and worn, this ring summons a familiar, a spirit that serves the user. The spirit takes the form of a small animal, such as a crow or cat, and can shift between shapes at will. It lacks a physical form and cannot interact with the world. It can, however, make physical contact with its summoner.

The familiar can move up to 100 ft away from its user. It has some intelligence, but is unable to speak, only communicating through telepathic emotions. If it is struck by a magical weapon or spell, it is destroyed, and reappears at dawn.
