# Dungeons and Deserts

#### What is Naevis?

Naevis is a low fantasy setting for **[Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition](https://dnd.wizards.com/start-playing-dnd)**. It's designed for survival adventure games that emphasize cunning, preparation, and creative problem solving. 

#### Highlights

* **Focused Character Creation**: Classes and races are restricted to [*Basic Rules*](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf) options, favoring a Swords and Sorcery genre.

* **Dungeon Crawling**: Short, brutal combat that rewards careful planning and alternative solutions. Make good use of bribes, diplomacy, and tactics to avoid costly confrontations.

* **A Brave New World**: [Words of Power](docs/more/secret_languages). [Motivation-based Backgrounds](docs/character_creation/background/index). [A Revised Economy](docs/gear/index). Changes that breathe new life into 5E without altering the base game.
