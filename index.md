# Dungeons and Deserts

#### What is Naevis?

Naevis is a low fantasy setting for **[Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition](https://dnd.wizards.com/start-playing-dnd)**. Players take on the role of adventurers exploring an otherworldly ruin, one filled with underground civilizations, dark gods, and sentient swords. 


#### Highlights

* **Swords and Sorcery**: Naevis is a world governed by mortal machinations. Trade and politics hold sway, rather than gods and magic. 

* **A Grounded World**: Class and race options are restricted to the [5E Basic Rules](docs/more/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf), favoring a deep roleplaying experience over a broad one. 

* **Tuned for Dungeon Crawls**: [Resting Restrictions](docs/adventuring/resting). [Encumbrance Systems](docs/adventuring/encumbrance). [A Revised Economy](docs/gear/index). Naevis incorporates several tweaks to existing systems to breathe new life into 5E without altering its core systems.
